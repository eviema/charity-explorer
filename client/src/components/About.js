              DonateNow is an online information hub for Melburnians to find a
              charitable cause in their local area that they are interested
              in, and a suitable charity to make donations to.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  explore local charitable causes (e.g. what they are, how
                  much donations and grants they receive),
                </li>
                <li>
                  find out about charities nearby (e.g. what they do, how much
                  they receive, how much they give), and
                </li>
                <li>
                  contact charities to discuss how they can do their share
                  (e.g. by referring to charity's address shown on a map and
                  discussing in person).
