Sports,Health and Wellbeing,"There was a massive improvement in world health and medical science in 1950s. Despite this improvement, there are many challenges which need to be solved as soon as possible. About one billion people lack access to health care systems with about 36 million deaths each year due to non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes and chronic lung diseases. Cardiovascular diseases accounted to 30% of all global deaths in 2005. Over 7.5 million children under the age of 5 years die due to malnutrition and mostly preventable diseases, each year. Number of overweight people is now exponentially increasing compared to the number of people suffering from hunger.In Australia, despite improving the health care system, Patient's out-of-pocket costs have grown 50% in the past decade and for some this is a barrier to needed care. According to studies by The University of Queensland in 2012, 10 percent of people in Australia are suffering from clinical anxiety. Making sure that every global citizen receives proper health care and that no one dies due to a preventable disease is a very costly affair. Let's help the millions of needful get their basic human right - health by taking one small step.",,Sporting activities undertaken only as a means of furthering a charitable purpose,Includes providing opportunities for people with a disability to participate in sport that they would otherwise be unable to and using sport as a means to ensure young people (who would otherwise disengage from school) continue their schooling,a school for young offenders who have disengaged from mainstream schooling ran an AFL training program with the local AFL club to increase engagement and attendance at school
