It is our individual supporters who have been willing to support an innovative idea with seed funding, back a young scientist through the challenging early years or purchase a new piece of equipment that will provide astonishing insights into medical biology.  this has allowed the Institute to be committed to making fundamental scientific discoveries that can be translated to better treatments, bringing real benefits to the community on a global scale.  Clinical trials based on discoveries made at the Institute include trials of vaccines for coeliac disease, diabetes and malaria; trials of new anti-inflammatory agents; and trials of a new class of anticancer drugs, called BH3-mimetics, for treating people with leukaemia and other cancers.At the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, donors are a vital part of the research teams.  Without our supporters we would not be able to take a risk on innovative blue-sky research, fund the challenging initial phase of drug discovery, or support the early work of our most promising young scientists.

We miss him.  We miss his basic goodness and kindness and talents and warmth.  The familyês aim in establishing this Scholarship Fund and an associated Trust has been to invest Piersê own assets for donating to recognised educational and charitable institutions associated with his life.  Piers was a senior training pilot with Qantas so our first aim has been to donate in the area of aviation education and training.  Piers also had volunteer involvement with the Salvation Army, Arthritis Victoria, and Scienceworks.  He was concerned for disadvantaged children and their education, and for homeless people.  He was an organ donor.  All of the things which represent Piers guide the work of the Scholarship Fund and its associated Trust, the Piers K Fowler Trust.  Details relating to the Fund may be found on the website of the Australian Charities and Not for Profits Commission (ACNC).  The Fund must deal specifically with scholarships.  The Trust may distribute benefits more widely but always to DGR-recognised institutions and always to the benefits which Piers would have sought.  The Fund and Trust together made donations of just over $90,000 in this latest financial year, bringing total donations and grants since inception to almost $200,000.  As in the previous year, our donations and gifts were virtually equal to the income earned during the year.  Reflecting Piersê own life, Aviation education, training and development forms a major part of the Fundês work.  We have a wide-ranging program of aviation-related Scholarships and awards with Swinburne University of Technology (SUT), including one overseas exchange award, support for an instructor rating course, a research award and a number of development / leadership awards.  We also support the SUT Mentoring Program for aviation students developed by Captain Mark Kreiger of Qantas.  Similarly, with the Aviation School of RMIT University, we provide a number of scholarships plus funds to support a Technical Library for all students.  We express our thanks to SUT and RMIT for their support and guidance in establishing our scholarship programs.  In other activities, the Trust is involved with Museum Victoria in the establishment of an interactive aviation-related display at Scienceworks.  Additionally, The Trust continues to support 15 Smith Family children and has provided funding to Melbourne City Mission, the Salvation Army and the Lighthouse Foundation in support of training and activity programs for homeless or potentially homeless people.  The Trust has made contributions in support of Move Arthritis Victoria, a Monash Medical School Scholarship, Ovarian Cancer Australia, St Yared a school for children in Ethiopia, and the Indigenous Literary Foundation.We are pleased to accept public donations (which have to be directed through the DGR-approved Scholarship Fund) but will not be seeking to develop that avenu",N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,0,0,0,1,0,750,37293,38043,10230,48273,0,0,43025,1693,44718,3555,652142,0,0,Y,

Community foundations act as a bridge for philanthropic giving between donors and beneficiaries. A great supporter of community foundations globally, the US Mott Foundation has written that there is a _simplicity and the power that underlies the community foundation concept, which is to create a local vehicle that can empower the residents of a community to support causes close to home and close to the heart.î  The RACV Community Foundation is that local vehicle for its supporters; the link between the donor, and the charities as the recipient.With a clear focus of improving quality of life of disadvantaged Victorians through mobility, the RACV Community Foundation provides grants to eligible charitable organisations in Victoria. Since its establishment in 1997, the Foundation has distributed $4 million in grants to eligible organisations.  Around half of the grants have been awarded to groups in rural and regional areas, and the Foundation has a strong focus on small, community-based groups.  The Foundation continues to gain understanding of current and emerging community needs. It undertakes investigation and exploration with policy makers, peak bodies, researchers and charities at the coal face to ensure its direction and focus on addressing important needs in the community.The annual granting program and corresponding review with recipients provides data and insight, enabling the Foundation to evaluate its activities against its mission, vision and aims.Along with mandatory strategies such as an investment strategy, the Foundation develops and implements multi-year strategic plans which provide a framework on which the Foundation can continue to build its impact.The Foundation complies with statutory obligations according to the relevant Tax and the Fundraising Acts, Public Ancillary Fund Guidelines, and the Australian Charities and Not For Profit Commission (ACNC). What are we here for?In challenging economic times, the community services that the Foundation helps to fund are being called upon more than ever. It is important that the RACV Community Foundation makes a significant contribution to the social fabric of Victoria. Through our fundraising, management of funds and distribution of grants, we aspire to the Foundationês current vision and mission.Vision: To provide a source of philanthropic funding for Victorian charitable and community organisations in order to enhance quality of life.Mission: To provide funds to grassroots community service organisations that look to increase mobility in Victorian communities, with a view to enhancing social cohesion, safety, and/or environmental sustainability.

We work to ensure they receive the very best support, information, treatment and care appropriate to their individual needs.We support, inform, represent and connect people whose lives have been affected by breast cancer.Every day in 2016, 43 women were told they have breast cancer. We know that no two breast cancer journeys are the same. Women differ in how they like to receive information and support. We develop and provide high quality information in a range of formats including information that can empower participation in decisions about treatment and care. Nearly 13,000 Australians newly diagnosed received our My Journey Kit in 2016, which goes some way towards providing that vital information and support.We know that it is not only the person diagnosed, but families, friends and whole communities that are affected by a breast cancer diagnosis. This is often a time when people turn to the internet.While there is plenty of helpful information to be found online, there is also information that may be unhelpful, inaccurate and scary. Our website provides a significant and credible resource for anyone looking for answers about breast cancer. The support of family, friends and colleagues is vital after a breast cancer diagnosis. However, even with a support network to draw on, our members often tell us their diagnosis made them feel isolated and alone. Communicating with someone who has experienced breast cancer can be of enormous benefit. In 2016, we connected our members in person and online. Since its launch in September, at all hours of the day and night, our new online network saw great geographic distances breached as visitors connected through their shared breast cancer experience.We also presented free information forums around the country. They provided information about the latest treatment and care, wellbeing, and services and support available in local communities. Our forums are developed from identified needs in the community and help establish connections with people who have had similar experiences.  Whether 10 days or 10 years post-diagnosis, all Australians affected by breast cancer deserve to have their needs represented and their voices heard wherever important decisions about breast cancer are made.We draw on the strength of our network to advocate on behalf of Australians affected by or at risk of breast cancer, and work to ensure best practice in treatment for all Australians. BCNA improved access to treatments in 2016 by successfully advocating for two key drugs to be made available through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) _ Nolvadex (tamoxifen) for women at increased risk of developing breast cancer and Herceptin SC (the subcutaneous form of Herceptin). In 2016 alone, BCNA supported, informed, represented and connected many thousands of Australians affected by breast",N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,37,17,5,48,985000,2329898,4540965,7855863,0,7855863,4372619,0,0,4297359,8669978,-814115,6799306,0,-814115,Y,http://www.bcna.org.au/

It exists to become a vital connection point for families in local Austrlaian communities.An African continent proverb states, It takes a village to raise a child. With that proverb underpinning some of our thinking, we encourage local groups to be that village. This extrapolates to being a place of care, an environment of learning, a setting where genuine encouragement provides mothers with the knowledge they are involved in a great and worthwhile role, and a space of fun, laughter and enjoyment.In a world of passive connection like Instagram and Facebook, mainly music provides an active connection, face-to-face, and memory-building.Here are comments passed on:mainly music is such a wonderful support for families just generally. And things like this [mainly music] are just what we need to keep our minds thinking positive thoughts. Thank you for all you do!!!Thank you for all the work that each of you ladies put into your amazing music sessions. I thought that you might like to hear the conversation that I had with Patrick while driving home today. He was reading his attendance certificate that he had been looking after with great pride. He piped up from the back seat, Hey Sarah, they love me!  I asked who? All the girls at music. Then he pretended to read the certificate out loud, We love Patrick. (hehehe)From a team member. Recently while shopping in my local supermarket, I encountered a young child, obviously distressed. He came around the corner of the aisle and approached me saying. _Blue shirt, blue shirt. Whereês Mum, I asked. He kept repeating the words _blue shirtî. A little while later, a worried looking young woman rounded the corner and a wave of relief washed over her face. Her son exclaimed loudly, with a sense of joy, _Mum, mum, blue shirtî. She looked at me and my attire and said _Oh, I see you are involved with mainly musicî. I realised I was wearing my mainly music T-shirt, having just come from our church's session. This mother and child do not attend our group, but he recognised the shirt and obviously thought I was a safe person to approach to help him find his Mum. I thank God for the mainly music program, and the impact it has _ sometimes in unexpected places!Aims and valuesThe organisation continues to uphold honour, connection, creativity, celebration and generosity as the five values from which to measure our activities and guide the planning and decision making.

We entrust and appreciate the agency and Child Protection workers taking on the responsibility of handing the most appropriate packs to children in necessitous circumstances. Often children are removed or relocated with little more than the clothes they are wearing. Donations and items bought from money fundraised are collected and sorted at our headquarters in Cranbourne, Victoria, then selections are made carefully and thoughtfully to ensure that packs include the most useful and needed items. Our packs not only give children some belongings of their own, encouraging self worth and a sense that someone cares, but also assist workers to focus more on the task of finding a safe location and carers more time to concentrate on welcoming and settling children being brought into their care.

Amazing where we have come to, all the while retaining our core principles of experimentation, collaboration, challenging the status-quo, exploring the unknown, making art with a multiplicity of peoples and cultures worldwide, consistently breaking through the ordinary, and creating the extraordinary. 2016 was one of our busiest and most successful years to date. The company undertook 12 local engagements, 5 national presentations and 4 International tours all managed by an amazing hard working team of dedicated staff and artists.Despite funding cuts 2016 saw Snuff Puppets continue to do what it does best. Two new works created internationally through workshops and collaboration. A major international presentation of our biggest and newest work to date, Everybody, and a new in-house puppet training and exhibition model that brought and brings a whole new eager audience and participation into the wonderful world of Snuff Puppets.A big part and the gritty reality of this wonderful world of Snuff Puppets is the managing and maintenance of hundreds of giant puppets that have been created, brought to life, travel the world then come home to rest in Footscray: their home a giant corrugated tin shed built in 1905. With the ongoing support of Creative Victoria and Maribrynong City Council we are able to create, house and manage this enormous collection of giant puppets in Snuff Puppets HQ the Footscray Drill Hall. For the first time in 2016 Snuff Puppets hosted numerous in-house events and workshops in the Drill Hall that saw hundreds of curious public come through our doors, looking, listening and participating in the Snuff Puppets world and philosophy. To be intimately engaged locally with our audience resonates deeply with the companyês ethos and it is hoped that this kind of public program of activity will grow and continue for years to come, expanding the function of the Drill Hall into a locally and internationally recognised building for the creation and experience of giant puppets, theatre and art making.

As a result of Specialisterne Australiaês activities during 2016, at 30th June 2016, 35 people with Autism Spectrum Disorder were employed in long term career roles that utilised their unique talents and capabilities and provided them with appropriate career and personal support. In addition, during 2016 Specialisterne Australia promoted the opportunity to hire people with ASD in order to attract unique talents capable of adding strength to the workforce. As a result, five additional organisations had committed to programs in 2016/17 which will translate into career opportunities for a further 60 people with ASD in roles in IT, Cyber security, records management, engineering and animal husbandry.It is anticipated that by June 2017 Specialisterne Australia will have created long term career positions in major Australian companies for over 150 people with ASD. A great start on our goal of 12,000 jobs by 2025.A key to the success of the Specialisterne program is our ability to reach potential employees with ASD when job opportunities arise. By establishing relationships with the major Autism bodies in Australia and understanding the capabilities of existing Disability Employment Services providers we have been able to establish a very effective pipeline to talent. In addition, by participating in industry events and through the development of a social media communication platform using Facebook and LinkedIn we have made direct contact with over 3000 people with ASD and their families. During 2016 a generous donation of $30,000 from the Telematics Trust Course Development Fund will allow us to develop a program of STEMLabs to allow people with ASD to assess their skills ahead of employment. This will have the added benefit of establishing a pipeline of talent for future employment programs.Looking forward we have plans to establish programs across Australia and also to extend our services to meet the needs of small to medium businesses who often lack the resources to independently administer diversity initiatives like ours. We have designed a program that will allow smaller employers to join together to manage an effective program that can attract and assess autistic program and also draw on shared support resources to help their new colleagues to succeed.",N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,Y,N,N,N,N,2,0,0,4,0,140050,184624,324674,0,324674,88977,0,0,203259,292236,32438,32439,0,32438,Y,http://au.specialisterne.com

It may assist to provide a brief overview of the issues and human consequences arising from the Commonwealth Child Migration Scheme, which have now been the subject of Government Apologies in both Australia and the UK.Approximately 7000 children aged 3-15 were deported from the UK to Australia without their families between 1912-1970.  Of that total, approximately half were sent during the post war years 1947-58.  These are the Trust's primary clients in Australia.  The human cost of child migration was profound;  we estimate more than 90% experienced physical or sexual abuse in Australian institutions.  Most never received adequate documentation and as a result lived their adult lives without information about their personal or family identity, nor a truthful understanding of the reasons for their original separation from their family.In addition, many children were deceived by those responsible for their care, that they were orphans, or 'war orphans';  which prevented many from searching for their families until it was too late to find them.

Finally, our Parish Council members have worked hard with us throughout the year. We have been blessed to have participants on the Council from each service group, with a range of ages, backgrounds, expertise and experience.  Property: Planning for the management of the property and stewardship of the physical resources was highlighted by the Wardens and Parish Council in 2015. Continuing that process, we have been active in several ways. Peter Whitehill has managed ongoing repairs, co-ordinated working bees, managed the repair of the carpet in the main hall and organised sub-floor work in the Wood Hall in preparation for the repair of the floor there. A working group has been formed to co-ordinate planning for the new kitchen for the Memorial Hall.  Longer term property plans include the renewal of the toilet block and replacement of the carpet in the main hall. With much thinking and praying and discussing, the PC articulated a new Christ Church Vision Beliefs and Values Statement.

Over the course of the year, VWL has been committed to reaching out to members and potential members with a diverse range of events and initiatives. We have focused on ensuring that our association is welcoming and inclusive to women lawyers and law students from a diverse range of backgrounds and perspectives, whether that be cultural, socioeconomic, LGBTIQ, regional and suburban.  VWL delivered almost 40 events and projects that were aimed at examining topics that are important to our members. These included: pay transparency, family violence, revenge porn, addressing unconscious bias, closing the gender pay gap, incarceration of indigenous women, career progression, culturally sensitive legal advice, flexibility and tackling sexism, harassment and gender discrimination. A series of regional events in Geelong, Bendigo and Shepparton, as well as recording and posting videos of our events on our website, represented our efforts to reach out to regional women lawyers.  We continue to contribute to public discourse on law reform and policy. This year our Law Reform and Justice Committees made submissions to the Senate inquiries on the phenomenon colloquially known as ´revenge pornê and the Fair Work Amendment (Gender Pay Gap) Bill, as well as the Victorian Gender Equality Strategy.   In 2016, VWL matched a record number of 187 pairs of mentors and mentees in our Law Student Mentoring Program. The Program continues to be highly valuable to women who are preparing to enter the legal profession. The second annual Warren Moot saw over 30 VWL members participate in the competition with many adjudicators from the judiciary and the Bar generously donating their time to adjudicate the moot rounds.

Further, we broker funding, promote projects to potential donors and facilitate briefings. Even in the event our partners receive funding, we continue to provide practical support in program implementation and grant acquittal and evaluation, and encourage the documentation of impact.Through introductions made at IGRG workshops, donor briefings and other associated activities, our partners have been successful in 2016 in obtaining philanthropic funding and pro bono support for key projects identified by their local communities. In this way our partner organisations' self-determination is supported.In 2016 we ran the Maarni Aboriginal Womenês Leadership Program, which supported eight women nominated by our partners with a tailored 12-month personal and professional development and mentoring program. Participants have reported their skills and confidence to take on leadership roles within their local communities have grown across the life of the program.In 2016 we progressed the Criminal Record Discrimination Project, a significant law-reform initiative addressing structural barriers to employment for Aboriginal Victorians. The project arose in response to feedback from our partner organisations around the urgent need for criminal-record law reform in Victoria.A broad range of stakeholders was convened to inform the project, including Elders of the Koori Court, the Law Institute of Victoria, and academic staff from Monash and RMIT Universities.Case-studies collected throughout 2016 highlighting_how current laws affect Aboriginal Victorians with a criminal record will inform a report to be presented to the statewide Aboriginal Justice Forum and the Victorian Attorney General in 2017.",N,N,Y,Y,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,0,6,5,28,0,204915,55,204970,0,204970,130290,0,0,52002,182292,22678,24510,0,0,Y,http://www.woor-dungin.com.au

Our local programs focussed on education which we believe is vital to a health society. Our ever-popular Student Welfare Outreach Team continued to deliver outstanding tutorials for VCE students wishing to achieve good results at school while struggling to pay the exorbitant prices for the standard revision courses. SWOT aims to provide everyone with the equal opportunity to determine their own destiny regardless of their background which is essential to health and wellbeing. In contrast, our Public Lecture program along with our conferences, AusWHO and the Undergraduate Global Health Case Competition, aimed to more specifically educate the public about global health issues and provide them with the skills to take charge and make a difference. This yearês themes revolved around current topics including epidemics and gender and health and were extremely well received. The significant increase in attendance of these events and the feedback from participants has indicated that the events are both engaging and informative.Our global programs continued to provide ongoing support to under-resourced communities overseas. The Kenyan Village Medical Education program continued its tour of villages in Kenya, providing educational sessions on topics such as diarrhoeal disease, water hygiene and malaria. The 2016 KVME trip established deeper connections with communities by returning to villages visited in 2015 and expanded the repertoire of presentations. The Material Aid Program continued to collect equipment from hospitals and clinics, sending it along with university students to under-resourced clinics. It also began to expend by also collecting monetary donations to purchase much needed equipment that could not be donated without cost. In particular, MAP assisted the devastated communities in Fiji following Cyclone Winston with assistance of the Katalyst Foundation on the ground in Fiji through the Rebuild Fiji Fund. The ongoing work of this partnership has resulted in significant structural and functional improvements in the Nabouwalu Hospital and the recent purchase of a much -needed ambulance for the region.MUHI has continued to build on its previous successes over the year through the hard work of its volunteers.

Our mission is to ensure that everyone in the community benefits from fair and well-functioning markets. These are big goals, so this year we have for the first time produced an Impact Report, to demonstrate the impact our work has on peopleês lives.Our advocacy is grounded in the experiences of the people we serve. Our financial counselling service and legal practice have again supported around 20,000 Victorians this year. We also actively support financial counsellors and community workers throughout Victoria, particularly through legal advice and training. This helps us expand our reach and ensures we are responding to the issues affecting the most vulnerable people in the community.Consumer Action has achieved some significant wins with Australians marginalised by unfair markets and business practices, including on issues such as retirement living and energy affordability. On the former, we worked with residents to place this issue on the Victorian parliamentary agenda Ü this work led to an inquiry into the retirement housing sector which is now underway.On energy, our ´Heat or Eatê report, which shared the stories of Victorians who had been disconnected from electricity or gas and contributed to an inquiry into financial hardship practices of energy retailers undertaken by the Essential Services Commission.As part of demonstrating impact and, importantly, to continuously improve on our efforts, the centre has this year engaged in significant evaluation activities, including evaluations of our legal advice line, financial counselling and worker advice services. Reports have been published on our website so we can share lessons with others.Our broader campaign work also utilises reflection and evaluation. An example involves our efforts to fix unfair energy contracts through changing national energy rules, a joint project with the Consumer Utilities Advocacy Centre. While we werenêt able to get the change we were seeking, the evaluation showed we had an impact on industry practice and helped other advocates push forward with change. Our advocacy also led to a Victorian ban on early termination (exit) fees when energy retailers change prices.We continue to hold ourselves accountable for making a tangible difference. We encourage you to delve into this report which demonstrates the impact weêre having on Australians and the  community workers who help them with consumer issues.Our 15/16 Impact Report is available online: http://impact1516.consumeraction.org.au/",N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,21,19,0,10,3651535,0,0,3651535,278470,3930005,3150946,0,0,933817,4084763,-154758,2208782,0,-154758,Y,

The agency has been operating under its current structure since 1997.  Our agency is a not for profit housing provider which caters to clients who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.   WAYSS support programs consist of Accommodation Options for Families (AOF), Drug Court Homelessness Assistance Program (DCHAP), Indigenous Tenants at Risk (ITAR), Initial Assessment and Planning Front Door services, Emergency Youth Accommodation Service (EYA), Women's Outreach Program, Private Rental Access Program, Social Housing Advocacy and Support Program (SHASP), Step Ahead Program, Youth Homelessness Support Program, Animal Assisted Education and Therapy Program, Childrenês Services, Family Violence Crisis Service, Family Violence Faxback Project, Family Violence Outreach Service, and the Safe at Home Program.   In the 2015/16 financial year WAYSS IA&P Dandenong office assisted 635 households to establish their tenancies, 109 to maintain their tenancies that were at risk and provided emergency accommodation for hundreds of families.  In Casey and Cardinia, 1368 households were assisted to either maintain or to establish their tenancies, as well as assisted with crisis housing.   284 of these households were assisted into private rental.   Our family violence outreach and our Womenês services outreach provided case management and supported 1443 women and their children.  499 women and their children were assisted by the family violence crisis service with accommodation.   The teams not only assist with the housing options but case manage these clients looking at both short term and long term goals.  All aspects of their lives are worked on including  financial, counselling service referrals, housing, childrenês issues, court support and legal referrals. Women have access to brokerage funds, HEF payments, and a psychologist all within WAYSS as well as childrenês workers and the Animal Assisted Education and Therapy Program designed to assist children who have been subjected to trauma in their lives.  Workers are currently working with an average of 15 clients, most of whom are looking for safe and affordable housing.  This is imperative to their recovery and breaking the cycle of abuse.   In total 9707 clients were assisted through WAYSS Womenês services for a one year period in 2015.   WAYSS also runs the Accommodation Options for families programs which assists families currently living in rooming houses to find more permanent and safer accommodation options.  This program has been a great success and is instrumental in getting these families out of inappropriate accommodation which is both unsafe and expensive.

We were in search of the two remaining vessels wanted by Interpol known as the _Bandit-6î.  It was later found that there was only one vessel remaining, being the Viking.As a result of our campaign, which departed Henderson, WA in January, we were able to successfully locate the Viking in Indonesian waters. We sent a team into shore and notified the Indonesian Fisheries minister, who then sent out the Navy to arrest the Viking. Subsequently, the Indonesian Navy decommissioned the Viking and now it sits off the Indonesian waters as a deterrent against illegal fishing.This meant that in less than two years, Sea Shepherd had managed to clean up the remaining six illegal Patagonian and Antarctic toothfish poaching vessels operating in the Southern Ocean.

In Cambodia, we funded a feasibility study and business plan in Stung Treng for a social enterprise training restaurant for women. In Nepal, we provided ongoing relief for earthquake survivors developed an action plan with our partners to ensure the regeneration and sustainability of womenês livelihoods. 6.2: We focus on ensuring womenês agency and control by resourcing women-led organisations and the women they serve as a way to catalyse transformative social change. All of the activities undertaken by us in 2015-16 have worked toward this purpose. 6.3: During FY15-16 we identified and funded various education and economic opportunities for women deemed relevant to the local context. In Cambodia, we provided a consultant to develop a business plan for a social enterprise training restaurant. The program is a contemporary solution to womenês poverty and is appealing to a younger demographic. In Nepal, prior to the earthquakes, we had been developing a suite of vocational training programs. After the earthquakes it was necessary to pivot towards relief work, and this remained our focus for the duration of FY15-16. 6.4: Provided our two partner organisations with ongoing financial support and technical support on the development of the following specific programs: Gender responsive earthquake relief in Nepal; shelter for pregnant women and new mothers displaced by the earthquakes in Nepal; consultancy on feasibility and business plan for training restaurant for women in Cambodia.6.5: During FY15-16 we continued to actively grow our online and offline communities. Online, we achieved a direct mailing list of over 1000 supporters, over 3000 members of our Facebook community, 1140 followers on Twitter and 1223 followers on Instagram, and provided followers with daily content around our work and the project of gender equality more broadly. Our major offline event for FY1516 took place in November. Titled ´The Disaster Agenderê, the event brought together 100 community members from across Melbourne to take part in a panel discussion about gender-responsive disaster relief. During FY1516 we received considerable media coverage, with op-eds published in mainstream publications including Womenês Agenda, Daily Life and The Age.6.6: We remained committed to making progress towards this purpose in FY1516.

The successes of the previous years, particularly our engagement of the broader community through the Landcare Community Dinner, has seen our membership grow to 85 members, representing 46 properties and accounting for the management of 3,612 hectares which is nearly 50% of the Strathewen Landcare Group Catchment. Over the past 12 months, Strathewen Landcare Group has been successful in planning and delivering:‚ reintroduction of the weed management incentive programs‚ mapping and control of priority roadside weeds‚ our Landcare Community Dinner‚ 2 weed information events‚ pasture and shelter belt information events‚ a pilot project on invasive weed mapping on private land ‚ completion of the 3 years invasive weed program, targeting Chilean Needle Grass, Serrated Tussock, Patterson's Curse, and Bridal Creeper‚ GIS workshopsWeed ProgramsThe three year grant funded weed program concluded over this past year.  The program has actively targeted the four priority invasive weeds raised awareness of these and other threats to our agricultural and bushland areas.  Our thanks to Carol and Ross Cardile for their leadership in this program. We piloted a weed mapping concept for private properties.  The intent of this project is to provide expert knowledge and advice to land owners on the presence, location and management of priority weeds.  5 member properties participated in this pilot, reporting significant change in understanding of invasive weeds and commitment to managing them.  The positive outcomes for this pilot has encouraged us to pursue grant funding to expand the program over the Strathewen Landcare catchment.  We are still waiting on the outcome of this grant application.We are intending to approach Nillumbik Shire Council with an application to the Land Management Incentive Program fro funding to support our Weed Management Incentive Program.  We ran this program successfully for many years, providing reimbursement of spray costs to SLG members, but it was disabled by changes to the LMIP. Community DinnerOur 2016 Community Dinner was another outstanding success, with nearly 100 Strathewen residents attending.  The catering was excellent and the kids program is key to the success of the evening.  A presentation by Terry Hubbard was well received.  Now looking forward to the 2017 dinner.

We rent an office from the Genealogical Society of Victoria (GSV) for a nominal amount. The GSV lease expires in 2018 at which time they will vacate the premises.

In 2016, the MSO engaged over 3.35 million people through digital and broadcast channels, live in concert, at festivals and free events, on tour, via workshops and in schools.  Through the generous support of government funding partners, corporate sponsorship, bequests and individual donations, the MSO evolves to inspire and engage audiences across Victoria, Australia and internationally by making orchestral music available to everyone.   Together with its vast calendar of concert performances _ 163 performances of 110 different productions in 2016 _ the  MSO delivers an extensive youth and education program in Melbourne and across regional Victoria, as well as a vibrant and celebrated talent development program to develop Australiaês next generation of musicians. A total of ten MSO programs champion Australiaês emerging artists, many of which could not exist without philanthropic support.  The MSO and its Chorus of 145 volunteers provided the Victorian community with 22 free concerts in 2016. Our Sidney Myer Music Bowl concert series is celebrated as an annual gift to the 30,000 people who attend each year; the MSO Chorus performances at ANZAC Dawn & Commemorative services (2016 live audience - 52,000) are also valued highlights.

We have come through another successful year providing care at Olivet and planning the future development of services for brethren and sisters. The committee has endeavored to exceed Government standards, provide activities for fellowship and spiritual wellbeing.   With our Fathers care and guidance we have met our financial goals and His continues blessing allows our ongoing viability and future planning.  Our priorities are to provide those things that identify us as The Christadelphian Welfare Association and provide accommodation in Independent Living Units, residential care, Respite and Day Care.  We have the help of volunteers who run and assist in many activities during the week and on weekends. Olivet has 80 listed volunteers who interact with the brothers and sisters each week and many more volunteers who run the Auxiliary fundraising activities and the many different brethren and sisters who attend the Memorial meeting each week to Exhort, Preside and play the piano.  Key Events: Moving into Admin Offices: Weêve now collected our reception and office area into one location, away from the living areas.  Now when we take personal enquiries and other meetings, we donêt interfere with the privacy of residents and the new location is going to be nearer the centre of the facility and much easier to welcome visitors and relatives and attend to the day to day administration.  Christadelphian Homes Conference _ May 2016: This is a biennial event held between the states where we have a formal venue for discussing the individual performance of our organisations within the general industry and what we think the future might hold.   The Conference was held over two days with members of the Committees of Management coming from NSW, SA & WA.   The topics ranged from presentations by Dr. Helen Rawson around research in aged care and the recognition that Dementia related illnesses are becoming more predominant in our society and specifically how it is managed by Carers to the changing face of the industry to Government funding and expanding competition.  This Conference not only keeps the respective Committees of Management in touch every two years but encourages and promotes regular contact throughout the year to share information and, when possible, take advantage of opportunities such as national supply contracts.  I would also thank the volunteers who arranged the wonderful dinner for all of our 60 guests.

His profound understanding of the Buddhaês principals of compassion, non-violence, harmony and self-responsibility, enables him to assist not only the expansive Buddhist community in Australia (this being the fastest growing religion in Australia), but also the broader Australian community.In a very short period since becoming a teacher for the Shantideva Buddhist Foundation Ltd, he has attained great respect and reputation. The Venerable Tsadong Rinpoche Ngawang Tenzin contributes both in and out of his teaching roles. He participates in a range of community activities providing spiritual guidance and support to a wide range of people. He is an outstanding leader and spiritual teacher. His personal qualities, his lineage and his profound grasp of Buddhist philosophy inspire people across cultures and generations.The wisdom and compassion Tsadong Rinpoche Ngawang Tenzin provides through his teachings, academic writings and personal interactions is of exceptional value to individuals, institutions and organizations and an on-going and precious asset to the Australian community.Another focus has been the establishment and upkeep of a website including videos of teachings and information of upcoming events, as well as the production of brochures, an email databhase, a Facebook page and other activities to disseminate the teachings, alert people of coming events and provide mindfulness training and Buddhist teachings. The teachings of Rinpoche and Buddhism in general help us to know the mind, to see how our mind works and how we often react habitually rather than respond thoughtfully, so that we can move beyond our narrow mind to embrace different perspectives. This openness and willingness to listen and embrace other perspectives helps our members and other people in Australia to adapt and thrive in a world where we are deeply interconnected and have to learn to collaborate if we are to survive and thrive. The principles of kindness and compassion emulated by His Holiness the Dalai Lama and all his monks and followers can only support Australians and the Australian culture. Buddhism propounds equality and that essentially we are all the same _ we all wish to be happy and to overcome suffering.The teachings of Rinpoche and the activities of The Shantideva Buddhist Foundation come from a position of understanding, compassion and humility.",N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,1,0,0,3,0,20588,0,20588,0,20588,36500,0,0,1864,38364,-17776,100369,0,0,N,

Through these activities the Association aims to be instrumental in optimizing the educational opportunities and outcomes for students in all government primary schools in Victoria.  To build leadership capacity in the sector, the VPA offered a high quality Professional Learning program to both members and non-members.  In 2015 - 2016 this included:  -  running and subsidizing over 35 full day workshops that encompassed the many aspects of school leadership. -  an Annual Conference with a two day program of renowned presenters and opportunities for collegiate discussions and networking.  -  the Principals as Literacy Leaders program involving five modules and ten hours follow up coaching for each participant.   This year 85 school leaders were involved in this program.  - a 16 day student study tour to China for 50 students and their teachers which provided outstanding opportunities for cultural exchange and understanding, language acquisition and personal development.   - a highly successful program for aspiring leaders.  - a Statewide Forum which included speakers who presented on a range of key areas in education and was attended by 160 schools leaders from across the state.   Another important aspect of the VPA's work is its advocacy role of advancing public debate in the education field.  This has involved the VPA representing the views and concerns of Victorian government primary school leaders and providing expert advice to government.  To this effect, the VPA was involved on an ongoing basis in government consultations, stakeholder groups and meetings with the various sections of the education department and associated government departments, with Ministers of Educations and other political leaders and with other professional groups and stakeholders.  The VPA has provided information and advice to school leaders through its Member Advisor service, a weekly VPA Newsletter and its website.   Collegiate networking has been facilitated by regular regional meetings where information about government initiatives and effective approaches to teaching and learning, student and staff welfare and school leadership are discussed and shared.   This year 37 such meetings were organised.  A particular focus for the VPA has been supporting smaller rural and remote schools to participate in professional learning.  Twenty scholarships were offered for leaders of these schools to attend the Annual Conference and casual relief teachers were funded to release teaching principals from their classes, enabling them to attend professional learning programs.

Many cannot afford it, other are unaware that it is available. This is the justice gap. Justice Connect helps close the gap by giving people free legal help.  In 2015-16, with our network of hundreds of lawyers we provided thousands of people with high quality, free legal advice, representation and training. This represents tens of thousands of hours of pro bono work for people and organisations who would have otherwise missed out. Our work helps to close the justice gap for people experiencing disadvantage and strengthens the capacity of the community organisations who work with them.Across all our programs, we received 6,644 requests for assistance and provided legal advice or a referral to 2,713 people (including community organisations) and training sessions to 2,435 community organisations.Our efforts to close the justice gap rely on the skill and hard work of our pro bono partners and members. To that end, we worked with 1,329 lawyers, including 212 barristers, to provide over 30,000 hours of pro bono legal work to our clients. We also offered support and guidance to all these lawyers, providing specialist training to 1,134 people (more than double the previous year). Our members include law firms, corporate legal departments, community legal centres, university law schools, the Law Institute of Victoria, the Victorian Bar. We are grateful for our membersê continued willingness to partner with Justice Connect and to support our vision.We continued our efforts to challenge and change laws that increase or perpetuate the justice gap. Across all areas of our casework, we identified, and advocated to change, unfair laws and policies.Most notably, our Homeless Law and Seniors Law programs made submissions to Victoriaês Royal Commission into Family Violence, highlighting the interconnectedness of family violence and homelessness, as well as the importance of considering elder abuse in the broader context of family violence. The recommendations of both submissions were taken up in full or in part by the Commissionês final report.Our Not-for-profit program also had a big year, taking its lauded Information Hub national, as well as receiving a three-year, $825,000 grant from the NSW Department of Family and Community Services to take our training and advice services even further into NSW.Our Referral Service targeted the ´legacy caseloadê of asylum seekers needing protection visas; Victoriaês ´expungement schemeê, allowing men who had been convicted under since-stricken sodomy laws to have those convictions removed; and helping transgender teenagers seeking hormone treatment receive the legal permission they require.You can read more in our Annual Impact Report athttp://www.justiceconnect.org.au/sites/default/files/Annual%20Report%20split%202016%20FINAL%20Web.pdf",N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,25,36,0,78,4056503,22462,1358783,5437748,0,5437748,4110756,0,0,1544778,5655534,-217786,1126427,0,-217786,Y,http://www.justiceconnect.org.au

To achieve these objectives, The Torch runs a state wide Indigenous Arts in Prisons & Community program that is set within the context of the Victorian Aboriginal Justice Agreement. Its focus is on the role of cultural strengthening and artistic expression in the rehabilitative process of Indigenous prisoners and ex-prisoners and redressing the over-representation of Indigenous people in the Victorian Justice system. The last twelve months has seen tremendous growth in activity at The Torch. Better resourcing has meant greater program delivery both to incarcerated Indigenous men and women in the 12 prisons in Victoria in which we operate and to participants in our post release program. At the beginning of 2016, the state government launched the Aboriginal Arts Policy Model initiative. This allows The Torch to act as agents for participants of the ´In Prisonê program and to sell artworks on their behalf. Money received from artwork sales is held in trust by Corrections Victoria and made available to artists when they are released from prison. This important development acknowledges the scope for our cultural program to reduce recidivism rates for Indigenous people. Cultural learning and art making builds confidence and social capital and, if we can build markets for art sales, the chance to make a living by selling artworks offers participants an achievable pathway to greater economic stability. Participating artists receive 100% of the funds of artworks sales and image licensing agreements facilitated by The Torch on their behalf.

The soundfield system is portable and can be moved from the church to the hall.

We wrote submissions to the Royal Commission on Family violence and the Victorian Inquiry into Abuse in Disability Care as well as multiple submissions regarding the NDIS, health and violence prevention. We piloted a Health Practitioner Education program in conjunction with the Royal Womenês Hospital about how to provide accessible quality health services to women with disabilities; and we have partnered with Deakin University in undertaking a national research program to better understand how family violence services respond to women with disabilities. Empowering women with disabilities is the focus of our Womenês Empowerment Program. WDV run Enabling Women leadership courses, mentoring programs and facilitate statewide safeguarding and leadership networks. We also have a Women Leading by Example workshop and the biennial Brenda Gabe Awards to further promote and encourage acknowledgement of community contribution and leadership of women with disabilities. Four Enabling Women leadership programs have been run in 2016 in the areas of Wangaratta, Bendigo, Doncaster and Footscray. These programs empowered women to be more involved in their local community and to understand how they can interact with local health and community services.

We now support 120 students at this school, delivering a personalised curriculum that is reviewed daily and includes an excellent sports program to supplement the academic one. The students are drawn from 4 local villages, on land donated by a local farmer whose dream was to see his children at school rather than working in the fields.  Yatra actively support Sports programme with equipment in all four GSK schools. Recently seven children from these schools were selected for admission into a national sports academy, validating the importance of sport in our curriculm. We have regularly held medical and dental clinics at this school, reinforcing our desire to integrate personal and public health measures into our school environment, to maximize learning. The school is being rebuilt with architecturally designed spaces and classrooms, with the money raised by our 2015 Yatra bike tour in November, which rode to the school with the students and teachers. This school has now become a _modelî school for the region with numerous government schools now wishing to emulate our teaching methods. To this effect, we have now seconded several teachers to a local government school to empower the local teachers and leverage our influence on education in the area.Yatra Isha Vidhya School, Cuddlelore, Tamil NaduLocated in southern Tamil Nadu, nestled near the tsunami-prone shores of the Bay of Bengal, Yatra foundation provides Teacher salary and Teacher training to enable local children to attend this state-of-the-art facility in conjunction with Isha Vidhya foundation. These students benefit from excellent classrooms and computer facilities and learn in a full English-medium curriculum. These students receive a nutritious daily meal, cooked on-site in the school kitchen and are drawn from the numerous local fishing hamlets scattered along this picturesque coastal region. Yatra foundation provides teacher salary subsidies to recruit and retain the best available teachers. We also provide training to local rural teachers to enhance their classroom skills and again, leverage our effectiveness in reaching a larger number of needy childrenRecently, 150 local headmasters and young teachers from 50 regional schools attended a workshop at the Yatra Cuddlelore School to learn about teaching methods, evaluation, and resource allocation. We hope to continue these workshops on a regular basis so that these teaching methods and processes can be disseminated around southern Tamil Nadu. We are now seeing some extraordinary academic results especially in science and computing. The children at this school now have hope with a belief and confidence that they can dream and accomplish great outcomes.

The Playgroups run on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday mornings from 9.30-12pm and are guided by experienced Programme Leaders. We offer children a wide range of activities. These include free play in our outdoor area with a slide, cubby, swing, sandpit and outdoor toys. Inside we have a variety of gross motor skills equipment like tunnels, a slide and walk board. Many role playing opportunities are available too with dress ups, kitchen play and dolls being the most popular. We also have a reading corner, puzzles, games, and play dough.

We delivered 28 speaking engagements as well as the Professional Development Conference for teachers and school staff.  The evaluation of our programs in 2016 demonstrates that we have made a positive impact on young people on the autism spectrum. In all our school mentoring and camp programs the most striking positive impact has been an increased sense of belonging amongst attendees and an increased self-belief in their strengths and abilities. Further as a result of our speaking engagements attendees have indicated that they have learned about autism and agree that how people think about autism needs to change.

In the process, P4T provides educational material to raise awareness of the existence of the problem of human trafficking and also challenges the attitudes of participants about respect for individual rights. This aspect is also aimed at reducing the incidence of domestic violence in the community. Local participating community groups encourage their participants to register and fundraise through the Pingpongathon website and online fundraising system.

We do this by undertaking policy development and advocacy in public and political arenas. The following ACSA activities meet these goals and purposes: ‚ ACSA engages professional researchers to investigate issues that affect the aged care sector now and into the future. In the past year, these issues have included the aged care workforce, housing for older Australians and care provision in regional, rural and remote areas of Australia. ‚ These research papers are then further developed through the National Advisory Committees and the annual National Policy Papers. ACSAês policy staff then develop these ´high levelê research papers into position papers and issues papers which are used to represent the views of not-for-profit providers to government ministers, members of parliament and Senators and government departments through formal meetings and submissions.‚ The Advisory Committees also raise sectorê concerns which ACSA then relays to government departments through written correspondence and face to face meetings.‚ ACSA staff and members represent the organisation on numerous government and industry related committees, putting forward the needs of not-for-profit and faith providers.  These forums play a key role in the development of policy at a national level and ACSAês involvement ensures that it is at the forefront of this process.‚ ACSAês Chief Executive and Media Relations and Communications Manager represent and advocate for not-for-profit aged care providers in industry and mainstream media by responding to interviews from journalists and by writing opinion pieces representing the views and policy positions held by members.‚ ACSAês annual national conference provides an opportunity for not-for-profit and faith-based providers to develop their voice by hearing from Australian and international experts, providing a platform for them to share their own learnings and successes and giving members an opportunity to hear from and engage directly with senior members of the government and opposition.‚  ACSA produces a quarterly publication called Agendas which promotes the sectors views internally and to government and consumers. The publication provides insights into key reforms and outlines the views of members to its diverse audience.ACSA coordinates an annual National Open Home Day throughout Australia, in conjunction with partner organisations in the UK, South Africa and Malta.

ALI's key focus is on matters that involve a broader public interest element and are of strategic importance to enhancing legal protection for animals. No matter the issue, clients can be confident that we will always give thoroughly-researched, clear and impartial advice. 2) Lobbying GovernmentALI works to challenge the way our legal system treats animals through effective advocacy. We have lobbied government on a range of matters to ensure animals are better protected under our laws and regulations. Our Policy Team has drafted and submitted a significant number of submissions on matters such as egg labeling, the greyhound racing industry, intensive farming and proposed ´ag-gagê legislation, as well as, more recently, a submission to the Productivity Commissionês inquiry into the regulation of agriculture. Notably, our submission in relation to the proposed ´ag-gagê legislation, the Criminal Code Amendment (Animal Protection) Bill 2015, was quoted a number of times throughout the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committeeês Report on the legislation. 3) Educating the legal profession and public ALI contributes to the education of the legal profession and the wider public on animal law matters as we believe that generating awareness is a key to creating law change.We successfully ran the Australia New Zealand Intervarsity Moot on Animal Law (ANIMAL) in 2014 and 2015, and preparations are currently underway for the third moot in September 2016. ANIMAL is the first and only national animal law moot in Australia and New Zealand. ANIMAL has grown from 14 teams in 2014 to 18 teams in 2015, making it one of Australiaês best-attended law moot competitions nationally. In 2015, ALI ran a very successful Animal Law Breakfast on the topic Dolphins and the Law - how to use strategic litigation to achieve a political outcome, presented by Australia For Dolphins. The presentation was both informative and inspiring, demonstrating how an alternative approach to animal welfare advocacy can achieve a successful outcome for animals.In 2016, we held the inaugural Animal Law Week, a week of presentations across the country delivered by an impressive lineup of people working at the forefront of animal protection in Australia and overseas. Topics ranged from puppy farming and animal law prosecution, protected species, the prosecution of animal crimes in the US and a day in the life of an animal lawyer.",N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,0,0,0,75,0,1720,19701,21421,0,21421,0,0,0,16636,16636,4785,3191,0,0,N,www.ali.org.au

HoMie clothes, trains and employs people who are experiencing homelessness in Melbourne. Clothing is distributed to the homeless community during monthly VIP Shopping Days in HoMie, where people who are homeless are invited to shop for free as ´VIP Customersê. On VIP Shopping Days, HoMie VIPs not only receive five complementary items of brand-new clothing and dignified shopping experience, but also receive free nutritious food, coffee and haircuts. VIP Shopping Days aim to increase feelings of social connectedness and bring our clients into contact with the HoMie Support Network. Alongside VIP Shopping Days, HoMie trains and employs young homeless Melbournians as retail workers. Through the training program, HoMie aims to provide a genuine pathway out of homelessness through the provision of confidence, skills and jobs.During the 2015/16 financial year, HoMie hosted eight (8) VIP Shopping Days for the homeless community, brought 217 homeless Melbournians into its support network, and distributed 1,085 items of brand new clothing to the homeless community. The HoMie Retail Training & Employment Program began in November 2015 and, although it is not currently an accredited course, has already assisted three (3) young homeless Melbournians. These young people worked a total of 251 hours with HoMie during the 2015/16 financial year, for which they received $5,975.00 in wages. In partnership with the Ladder Foundation, Knowledge Space, Cotton On and Bendigo Bank, HoMie is in the process of designing an accredited Retail Training & Employment Program, to be piloted throughout 2016-17. The Retail Training & Employment Program will see four (4) homeless Melbournians housed, trained as retail workers, and employed by the Cotton On retail chain upon successful graduation next year.2) Charity Tap: Charity Tap is a fundraising system that enables Australian hospitality businesses to fundraise effortlessly for charity. During the 2015/16 financial year, Charity Tap raised $13,333.10, of which 85% was pledged to Oxfam, the Melbourne Period Project, Kids Under Cover and the Self Help Addiction Resource Centre. 15% of funds raised by Charity Tap were used to cover its running costs. 3) Homelessness in Melbourne advocacy:   ´Homelessess in Melbourneê is a social media advocacy program which shares the stories of people who are currently (or have previously) experienced homelessness, to raise awareness of this global issue.

SEED: In FY2016 Seed, a branch of the AYCC and Australiaês first indigenous youth climate network continued to grow with volunteer groups extending across the country to bring our educational and leadership programs to a wider demographic of young people, giving opportunities to young people often missed by youth development programs. In FY16 we held a national youth Indigenous conference where 80 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people from every corner of the country came together on Gadigal country in Sydney for a transformational summit. The four day summit included skills workshops, regional planning sessions, opportunities to share stories and knowledge, a sustainability project launch and a media action. SEED participants then engaged in sustainability projects in their communities to protect land, educate their peers and reduce pollution in their hometowns.Switched on Schools: Switched on Schools is AYCCês high school program that has been running for four years across Australia. In FY16 we delivered 11 summits, engaging around 1200 students. Summits are two-day events where high school students and teachers come together to learn about climate change, sustainability and how to create change in their schools and local communities. At these summits students start sustainability projects such as reducing paper waste, planting vegetable gardens and trees, and putting solar panels on the roof, that they then take back and develop at their schools.AYCC volunteers also delivered in school workshops to 130 schools and reached a further 20,000 students through presentations and online engagement platforms. The schools project has also worked with students from 390 schools through our Student Climate Action Network where students continue their engagement in their sustainability projects and create networks with students from other schools. Training: In FY16 AYCC empowered 450 young people through a combination of national, state and regional training camps, equipping young leaders with the skills, networks and information they need to lead sustainability projects and campaigns in their communities to protect the natural environment from climate change.  In FY16 AYCC also continued the Climate Leaders Training Program, an intensive 9-month training program which brought together 80 young leaders from around the country for 3 intensive 4-day training retreats, where they built networks and gained the skills and confidence they need to help solve climate change. In between these training retreats, participants applied their knowledge and skills to the movement by committing to 8 hours of volunteer work each week.",N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,N,Y,Youth - aged 25 to 30General community in Australia,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,20,11,35,600,434484,2049117,76252,2559853,0,2559853,1556744,0,0,912016,2468760,91093,572694,0,91093,N,http://www.aycc.org.au

VACCHOês Members serve as an advocate for their community and in turn, VACCHO serves as an advocate for its Members, championing Aboriginal identity as an inseparable aspect of a comprehensive healthcare system.  VACCHO recognises the importance of education and pre-emption in effective healthcare implementation and exists to enable our Members to instil healthy attitudes and beliefs throughout their community.  This approach helps negate the many complex health issues causing a decline in the wellbeing of Aboriginal peoples by preventing serious illness.  Our determination to close the gap between the health equalities of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples is the driving force behind our approach.  An important factor in the success of this outcome is our holistic approach to health that ensures that administered care is representative of Aboriginal culture.  When healthcare is culturally safe the treatment is far more effective.  Achieving mainstream recognition of this correlation is integral to securing the funding that will demonstrate the long term effectiveness of culturally appropriate healthcare.   VACCHO strikes to convey that sickness does not only affect the physicality of Aboriginal peoples.  When Aboriginal culture is dismissed it can cause damage to our social, emotional and spiritual wellbeing.   Spirituality and physicality are inseparable in Aboriginal culture; that which affects one affects the other just as acutely.  Unfortunately, spiritual healing can be difficult due to the general incompatibility of mainstream health services and Aboriginal culture.  VACCHO recognises the importance of spiritual healing and its importance in improving health outcomes for Aboriginal people.  By allowing Aboriginal culture to thrive, so too will its people.   VACCHO advocates for Aboriginal health on two fronts: treating the physical illnesses affecting Aboriginal health and celebrating Aboriginal culture in a vibrant community.  ´In respect to the goals and principles of community control within the Victorian Aboriginal health sector, it is essential to ensure that the services VACCHO provides meet the needs of its Members, stakeholders and ultimately the community which it servesê.  VACCHOês leadership role involves building the capacity for community advocacy and workforce development by strengthening the support network of our Members.  This advocacy takes place in a range of private, community and Government agencies at a state and national level, recognising all issues relevant to Aboriginal health.  VACCHO represents the community controlled health sector nationally through its membership on the board of the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (NACCHO).

Further, we have hosted over two-dozen workshops for families in understanding and preparing for the NDIS. We are pleased that through this process of supporting families to imagine better lives, and of undertaking detailed pre-planning, they have been able to accurately articulate their needs as individuals and as a family. It is intended that in line with the aspirations of the NDIS that these people will begin to receive reasonable and necessary supports based off this work, and at the time of writing the first people we support and their families have been able to secure plans that for the first time recognise their global needs.We have also launched Inclusion Designlab and Inclusion Training. Together with our core business of supporting people to imagine better lives and developing lives of distinction within the local community, these new arms will support and learn from our sixty-five years of dreaming of better lives for people. The role of Inclusion Designlab is to pursue answers to the questions raised by the hundred people we support and their families and carers. Questions such as ´How do I vote?ê or ´Where do I go to get help for my teeth?ê or êHow can I participate on my local councilês Disability Advisory Committee?ê Through partnering with philanthropic foundation we can commit the time and effort to develop resources and training that not only benefit the people we support, but also other people with intellectual disability and their families and carers. Evidence of our work is beginning to mount, with materials developed by the Designlab being sold and adapted for use in Western Australia and Queensland.

The Mitchell Institute is one of the Fundês ongoing projects, a venture in partnership with Victoria University, dedicated to tackling health and education policy issues affecting Australia.

The Institute's focus is on socially and economically disadvantaged communities and the transformational change effective education and good health can deliver.

It is expected to cut carbon emissions in the state by around 15%.We helped sustain the moratorium on onshore gas drilling in the state of Victoria. Climate science makes it clear that the time for new fossil fuel production is over if we want to protect the natural environment, and additionally, methane pollution through fugitive emissions is increasingly of concern to climate scientists. We were heavily involved in the state governments Inquiry into the onshore unconventional gas industry. During 2015/16 we increased the work we do around the issue of ´energy shiftingê (moving from reliance on gas to electricity from green power sources), including commissioning a major report on the topic. We also worked to develop a clear plan for economic diversification in the Latrobe Valley.We helped establish the Victorian Roadside Vegetation Network, to highlight the vital ecological role of roadways, especially in largely cleared rural areas. We engaged with land managers and government bodies to ensure minimal impacts occur around major road widening operations, and helped secure the protection of several hundred very old Red Gum trees in a number of locations.We carried out research work into the population of the Strzelecki Koala (a genetically significant sub species) through scat surveys in the Strzelecki Ranges, to the south east of Melbourne. This research substantially filled gaps in knowledge about the species distribution and eating and other habits. During this time a new sub species of eucalyptus was identified for the first time. Surveyed in bluegum plantations in western VIC to identify koala numbers and the impacts of clearing operations. We carried out research into the ecological benefits of Indigenous Protected Areas. We worked locally to gain better management and funding for the Nyah-Vinifera Park, on the mid Murray River in northern VIC.  We researched the likely impacts (and subsequently opposed) planned ´ecological thinning trialsê on public land in both VIC and NSW. We organised a series of ´citizen scienceê workshops in forests on public land in East Gippsland (VIC) to identify distribution of a range of endangered plant and animal species.After more than 20 years of work to gain protection of key ecosystems in the Strezlecki Ranges, south east of Melbourne, the state government has announced the first formal transfer of land into the Strezlecki Cores and Links Reserve.

As a major voice in the Australian art music scene this goal is truly commensurate with the organisationês international standing.Highlights included a collaboration with Ilan Volkov in his Adelaide Festival Tectonics which, amongst the other world premieres, included a piece with The Necks and the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra, Anicca and Bell Curve at Arts House and a return to Indonesia with two projects for the Salihara International Performing Arts Festival (SIPFest).Creatively the organisation integrated emerging and experimental technologies including the development of new hardware and software for 12 networked wireless click tracks, a rotary encoder tracking the movement of percussion instruments on a spinning table with light, tactile transducers and the development of ice percussion instruments.New partnerships were formed with entities such as Unconformity Festival, Hotel Hotel, Assemble Papers and RMITês Industrial Design Department. Importantly strong existing relationships were cemented including with MPavilion, Arts House, The Substation and the SIPFest.The successes of the year came in many forms, further to three Green Room Award nominations was winning the Art Music Award for Excellence in Experimental Music and a 4.5 star rating from Limelight for our Fluorophone season at The Substation.Another key artistic goal for Speak Percussion has been to make work which will endure and sustain meaning beyond the occasion of its premiere. This goal, as before, depends on quality, impact and scale but is importantly also linked to depth of practice, ownership and securing subsequent performances. I am also extremely heartened that many of the successes of 2016 continue to resonate in 2017, projects which premiered in 2016 including Bell Curve, Fluorophone, The Trading Routes, Brutti ma Buoni and Fault Traces have had confirmed repeat presentations in 2017. This is a testament to the strength of the work and artistic vibrancy of the organisation.Speak Percussionês artistic achievements were matched by significant organisational milestones and financial successes. These included:‚ Triennial funding _ 4 streams at three levels of government‚ Confirmation of 4 year funding from the Australia Council for the Arts (with 89% increase) and Creative Victoria (with 5% increase)‚ 15% increase in net assets‚ Bespoke program launched  ‚ Awards _ including Art Music Award for Excellence in Experimental Music for Speak Percussion and Emerging Melbourne Prize for Music for Matthias Schack-Arnott",N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,2,1,38,23,279259,21144,87201,387604,1058,388662,293316,0,0,85982,379298,9364,71605,0,9364,N,

A quality coaching program which develops skilled coaches within Christian organisations dynamically enhances the development and uniqueness of such organisations from within.   Rather than relying on external direction, where standards, consistency and capability may vary, organisations are learning to become _learning communitiesî where social engagement, spiritual development and communal involvement are explored and discovered in the local context.  The trend across many Christian organisations is to focus on the _leader as coachî approach in order to develop and equip emerging leaders in a constantly changing environment.  This trend also ensures a consistency of the organisationês intent, expressed in its culture and leadership programs. In addition, Christian leaders are finding they require much more than spiritual and theological formation; they increasingly recognise the need to lead change, develop leaders and connect socially and professionally with the wider community.

We act as advisers and legal representatives to the environment movement, pursuing court cases to protect our shared environment. We work with community-based environment groups, regional and state environmental organisations, and larger environmental NGOs. We also provide strategic and legal support to their campaigns to address climate change, protect nature and defend the rights of communities to a healthy environment. While we seek to give the community a powerful voice in court, we also recognise that court cases alone will not be enough. Thatês why we campaign to improve our legal system. We defend existing, hard-won environmental protections from attack. At the same time, we pursue new and innovative solutions to fill the gaps and fix the failures in our legal system to clear a path for a more just and sustainable world.

CHASS has an estimated reach of over 50,000 individuals through its member and affiliate networks.

Our work has also opened new areas of engagement for HASS in government priorities such as science engagement and social policy arenas. Our annual CHASS Australia Prizes are designed to honour distinguished achievements by Australians working, studying or training in the HASS areas, including academics, practitioners, philanthropists, policy makers and students. In 2016, we received 230 nominations across the four categories, our highest haul since the Prizes were established in 2014.

We work specifically with women who suffer from social and economic disadvantage, and who are lacking adequate support.  This may include, but is not limited to young women, culturally and linguistically diverse women including refugees and asylum seekers, and those who have experienced or are experiencing poverty, trauma, abuse, or mental health challenges.  Through our work we seek to reduce the risk of psychological stress, birth trauma, and peri- and post-natal depression, and subsequently improve outcomes in maternal and infant wellbeing, childbirth recovery, and parent-child attachment for those who are most vulnerable.  Birth for HumanKIND is non-denominational and has no political agenda.  To do this the Company will undertake the following activities:  1.  provide a free service offering continuous one-to-one  doula care during the pregnancy, birth, and postnatal  period to reduce the distress and disadvantage of  vulnerable women;   2.  provide information and education about childbirth preparation, maternal health choices, and the maternal health system for women in Australia targeted specifically for disadvantaged women and recent arrivals;   3.  provide advocacy and onward referrals to relevant community and health agencies, and build community partnerships to support the relief of birthing women in socially and economically disadvantaged circumstances;   4.  raise awareness about the benefits of continuous doula care and informed birth choices in reducing the psychological and physical health risks of pregnancy and childbirth, and improving maternal, child and family health, with specific reference to disadvantaged women, their children, families and communities.  We have undertaken the following activities and achieved the following outcomes, as set out in our purposes:  1.  Free doula service: -  Recruited additional 15 volunteer doulas (total volunteer  doulas = 30) -  Supported 76 women  2.

We supported, promoted and facilitated group music-making through our developmental program of group music-making leadership skills workshops, and through our active music-making program, which included two weekend music-making camps and a range of other gatherings. CMVic also: produced a monthly newsletter distributed free to about 2000 people, provided advice about choirs and instrumental music groups while continuing to gather information about such groups and further developed the website, www.cmvic.org.au, which has a search facility for people looking for choirs or instrumental music groups along with news and information. 2016 was a specially significant year in terms of one of our key aims _ enabling people from more diverse backgrounds to participate in inclusive group music making. Four projects have been outstanding in this area: Sing English _ working with EAL teachers in partnership with the Urban Lyrebirds, to help them gain skills and confidence in using singing in their classrooms teaching migrants including refugees and asylum seekers; Singing from Country _ linking Victorian songwriters and community to Aboriginal knowledge holders, naturalists and ecologists to create and sing songs that help reconnect people to place; StreetSounds _ a joyful explosion of new street bands of new street bands across Victoria with participants from many backgrounds; Singing for Inclusion, run in partnership with Creativity Australia, was designed in 2016 and will continue to increase the capacity of the networks of Victorian community singing leaders to lead inclusive singing groups and choirs.

During 2016-17, Bush Heritage developed a 2017-22 Plan which focuses on the vision _Healthy Country, protected foreverî and purpose To return the bush to good health.",Y,"This year was the second year in which Bush Heritage Australia used international standards, known as Impact Reporting and Investment Standards, to report on its protection and enhancement of the natural environment. These standards allow Bush Heritage to demonstrate the extent to which its on-ground conservation activities have improved the health of the native species and landscapes it manages, the extent to which it has reduced the severity of threats to those species and landscapes, and how it has leveraged the effectiveness of its operations to achieve the best possible outcomes for Australiaês species and landscapes.In 2017, Bush Heritage launched its strategic plan for 2017-2022, after achieving the goals set out in its strategic plan for 2012-2017. Those achievements include protecting and managing 6.2 million hectares of land for conservation, either directly through reserves or in partnership with others. That land and our management activity now protects habitat for 5812 species and of those species, 235 are listed as threatened on either a state or national level. In 2016-2017, Bush Heritage also contributed or played a leading role in 81 research projects with partners from 24 universities or other organisations. It also supported five science scholarships and employed two science interns, worked on reintroduction trials for five significant species, and saw 21 peer-reviewed papers published based on work that occurred on our reserves. These achievements are in line with the actions outlined in our Science and Research Plan for 2015-2025, and have contributed to us meeting our 2017 goal of demonstrating leadership and innovation in nature conservation. They occurred alongside the routine monitoring, management, survey and inventory work that occurs on all our reserves and partnership properties every day. Strengthening engagement with volunteers, supporters and the general public were also priorities. In 2016-2017, volunteers contributed 36,660 hours of their time to Bush Heritageês work _ equivalent to $1.29 million based on the national standard hourly rate. Approximately 27.5 million people across Australia were reached through local and national media stories about the organisationês work.   For the last two years, Bush Heritage has achieved its 2017 target of maintaining annual income at, or near, $20 million _ a powerful show of support for our work. We now have more than 32,000 financial supporters (exceeding our 2017 goal to have over 30,000 supporters) and over 460 volunteers, making it more important than ever to stay connected using modern and efficient systems. This year, we invested in such systems, including an interactive website and a new supporter relationship database.

The main areas of activity conducted by FSC Australia in pursuit of this mission in 2015 fall into five broad categories: National Standard, Indigenous Engagement, Strategic Partnership, Strategic Realignment, and Growth & Insights. During 2016 the focus of our policy development was advancing the first FSC Australian Forest Stewardship Standard through drafts 3 and 4, with extensive stakeholder feedback captured through waves of public consultation equipping our Standards Development Group to reach agreement on a range of areas. These included the High Conservation Values Framework, a simplified approach to Scale Intensity and Risk, a refined approach around Sustainable Yield and - with the help of our Indigenous Working Group, culturally appropriate and robust controls around Indigenous Rights. The draft Standard also includes new requirements for social impact assessment and refined provisions for engagement with stakeholders and local communities. During 2016 we made considerable progress in the development of an Innovate Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) guided by our Indigenous Working Group, to express and deliver our commitment to recognising and advancing the rights, interests and values of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.  With financial assistance from Tork Professional Hygiene, FSC's Future Generations program, developed with Deakin University, was launched in TermTwo 2016. Future Generations aims to bring the cross-curriculum priority of sustainability into every subject - fro Arts to Humanities and English. Future Generations includes six series of lesson plans and activity sheet. These free lesson plans are available for primary school levels 1-6 and are in line with AusVELS curriculum.   FSC Australia supported communication around the Rio Olympics, highlighting the fact that all wood and wood products acquired by the Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games were FSC certified, from structures to stationery, from podiums to medal cases. We reached over 5 million people, with almost 500,000 taking an active role in sharing or visiting our related information.

This partnership provides access to large cancer patient populations, enables the further development of clinical research and clinical trials, deepens cancer research and education capabilities and will enable wider impact on more patients for improvement in cancer results.The VCCC partnershipês strategy for building a centre of excellence has been to generate new data to support cancer clinical service improvement, expand the cancer research capabilities of our partners and develop new methods for more rapidly translating research discoveries into routine clinical practice.The VCCC partnershipês research strategy has been to identify our cancer research strengths and gaps that must be filled, measure and benchmark our research performance, invest in the very best researchers, build innovative shared research platforms and build translational research structures and opportunities.The Leaders in Cancer Research Program has been the VCCC partnershipês vehicle to recruit and retain the very best researchers, clinicians and teachers. It is building depth, breadth and excellence in our people conducting cancer research. It has built new research programs in priority areas with recent appointments in nursing research, palliative medicine and genomics. Further recruitment of research leaders is underway in surgical oncology, psycho-oncology, bioinformatics and gynaecological cancers. Between them, these appointments provide a magnet for other talented cancer researchers and an effective mechanism for attracting additional research capability and industry funding. The Tumour Stream Leads pilot program is aimed at developing and translating new research directly into clinical practice and expanding research opportunities. Research and Education Leads across all VCCC partners were appointed for two tumour streams, melanoma & skin cancer and haematology, and one cross-cutting theme, primary care. The role of the leads is to bring together key researchers and clinicians around a particular cancer or theme to expand research opportunities and to embed new discoveries into practice more quickly. The leads have already initiated workshops to improve genomics literacy in haematology and on the evolving role of primary care in cancer. The appointment of Research and Education Leads for three further tumour streams/themes is currently underway, including for nursing, lung and gastrointestinal cancers.In 2016, the VCCC conducted a second Cancer Patient Experience Survey (CPES) across the expanded VCCC partnership, with data collected for over 3,500 patients.

We also partnered with the Against Malaria Foundation.We then undertook activities to raise funds to be able to grant to these partner organisations, including helping to organise the EAGxAustralia 2016 conference, recruiting volunteers and soliciting donations via our website.The organisations we partner with and grant funds to are regarded to be amongst the most effective at alleviating poverty by independent charity evaluators, including GiveWell and The Life You Can Save.By supporting their work we are supporting some of the most effective interventions that are proven to alleviate poverty. Provision of insecticide treated bed nets significantly reduces the burden of malaria and the impact that the disease has on economic outcomes. The treatment of schistosomiasis and other helminths not only reduces the health burden of these parasitic diseases but has also been found to result in improved education outcomes in children and also translate to higher income potential in adulthood.

This was a Uniting Church conference, and the experience was uplifting for us and the audience. In October we participated in a workshop, and then performed, with Orkeztra Glasso Beshalde for the Village Festival in Edinburgh Gardens. Following this, we then performed a full length show with Orkeztra Glasso Beshalde for Darebin Music Feast. It was a great experience singing with and meeting the orchestra, and some fine dancing was done also.In December we did our customary performance at Carols In All Nations, followed by a break-up Christmas party and performance at St Vincent's Hospital.These events were enjoyed by all and attended by extended family members. They also furthered our choir's aim of demonstrating to the community the commitment and talent of our members, many of whom are living with moderate to severe disabilities.We also did a story session which was quite profound for all who were able to attend. Choir members worked with Jenny and Peter in a very trusting way and the result was a sharing of aspects of people's life stories which deepened our connection and respect for each other. It was a wonderful experience and gave some inspiration as to the deeper conversations we could be having. During the first few months of the year we basked in the glory of the Darebin Community Group of the Year Australia Day award received the year before and presented in January 2016. It is still a lovely reminder of the communityês esteem of our choir. A Communication Strategy was written in April 2016 and is a helpful guide for future thinking and planning. We also conducted a 'Relationship Building Project' with the aim of increasing our contacts with professionals, as well as promoting and educating the community about our choir.

And our new home looks amazing (thanks to Jane Hartnell and Jade Borjesson)!In terms of numbers, we delivered over 25 workshop programs each term and filled over 15,000 workshop places. But the exciting developments in 2016 were around the renewal of our strategic vision and program improvements. The primary goal of increased sustainability was addressed by prioritising community engagement, program review and stakeholder management.Our success engaging communities is evidenced by growth of our term program and relationships with local councils, in particular our own Council, Darebin, with whom we commenced an Arts Partnership Initiative in 2016. We enjoyed ongoing partnerships with Moreland Council and Hume Council and, a new long term project starting in 2017 sees us partnered with Banyule Youth Services, Headspace and Concord School.Our program review affirmed access and inclusion as a foundation of our activities and resulted in a strengthening of our arts in education programs. In 2016 we were approved as an NDIS provider, and planned for our disability circus program, MY Circus, to move from a funded project to a self-sustaining social enterprise. Our other access and inclusion programs had us working with Furlong School for Deaf Children and Ignition Theatre, as well as building new projects in partnership with Occupational Therapy Service providers to deliver more structured and targeted circus programs to a broader number of young people living with a disability.As for Arts and Education, we worked with Melbourne Polytechnic to deliver a tailored Certificate IV in Training and Assessment. This was done in response to one of our education partners, Shepparton ACE College, wanting to bring circus into their curriculum. It also presents an opportunity for Westside Circus to formalise a more structured approach to the way we use non-formal education methodologies within formal education settings. In 2016, Westside Circus became one of four partners to deliver an international project, funded by the European Union. National Treasures is a collaborative research project, youth exchange, creative development, and a platform for future international opportunities.",N,N,N,N,Y,Y,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,Y,1,3,45,15,130475,56599,318416,505490,9924,515414,377547,0,0,109595,487142,28272,31114,0,28272,N,http://www.westsidecircus.org.au

Sponsorship projectOlive Kidsê sponsorship program expanded to support 214 orphans this year. Olive Kids is committed to the ongoing continuation of this critical program, offering sustainable support from our kind Australian sponsors to our children in Gaza totalling $128,400 in annual aid.Olive Kids also continues to improve this program, to ensure orphans services are covered and a portion of the sponsorship is set aside for the orphansê education. Additionally, this year Olive Kids began making arrangements for the construction of an Olive Kids wing at Al-Amal Institute for Orphans.Clothes DrivesThe ongoing clothing drive program continued during the year. High quality used clothing and toys were collected throughout the year. Shipment is expected at the end of the calendar year. As per usual arrangements, the shipment is targeting the refugee camps in Jordan, and will be distributed in partnership with UNRWA.Annual DinnerThe Olive Kids 8th Annual Fundraising Dinner was held on the 29th of May, at Peninsula on the waterfront of Victoria Harbour, Docklands. This yearês event was the most successful one to date as reflected by the astounding fundraising effort. As a result of this event we were able to raise $100,500 in pledges towards the construction of an Olive Kids wing at Al-Amal. In total, including major donations both local and international, Olive Kids has raised $229,379 for this project.    This yearês Empower Gaza campaign aims to accomplish the following:‚ Install solar panels at Al-Amal to enable them to have a more constant source of electricity and significantly reduce the current monthly energy bill of USD$20,000‚ Sponsor 50 additional orphans‚ Send a new medical mission to Palestine‚ Ship another container of aid to the refugee camps‚ Fund the expansion of Al-Amal in Gaza by building an Olive Kids wing. This new wing will enable Al-Amal to host children from as young as 1 day old up to 5 years of age. At a total cost of $200,000, a whole floor would allow the orphanage to house a total of 75 additional children.Medical MissionsIn collaboration with the Union of Health Work Committees  (UHWC), Olive Kids facilitated an Australian medical mission to Alwada Hospital in Gaza. Lead by Associate Professor David Croacker (General and Neonatal Paediatric Surgeon) and also including Mr Paul Chicchio (Nurse) and Ben Wagstaff (Doctor), the team conducted many operations and ran multiple training sessions for local surgeons. Per the ongoing arrangements, Olive Kids covered the costs of airfare and accommodation.

Through an extensive grant making program, the Foundation supports families undergoing treatment, partners with hospitals to deliver clinical excellence and funds clinical research and clinical trials with the aim to develop new and kinder treatments for children with cancer. In 2015/16 the Foundation supported families through the stress of cancer treatment by funding the salaries of Family Resource Coordinators, and by providing therapeutic storybooks and Music and Art Therapy to assist children with adapting to treatment. The Foundation also funded The Beaded Journey, a therapeutic program which helps each patient mark every treatment milestone with a special bead; this program assists children and their families to cope with their cancer experience and relate their experience visually. In 2017 the Foundation will announce major new grants for projects that span the cancer treatment journey, from family support and clinical care to ground breaking clinical research and clinical trials, including one national project.At all times, the Foundation endeavours to raise funds in a way which is both efficient and ethical. The Foundation does not conduct public raffles or telemarketing. Nor do we receive government funding. Funds are raised through The Million Dollar Lunch, community fundraising, corporate sponsorship and donations. A volunteer board of directors and a large team of dedicated volunteers help us maximise our fundraising income, while the generosity of many pro bono supporters _ office space, marketing, design, legal and insurance _ ensure that our administration overheads over the past 5 years have averaged just 9%.

We currently offer three learning experiences:  ? Our FORUM engages and inspires action on global health inequities. The program is shaped around five ´personasê that capture the diverse spectrum of action that leads to global health impact. Participants leave with new knowledge of the range of global health issues and the ways we can act individually and collectively; and empowered to continue their educational journey with new networks to connect to opportunities and new tools to approach challenges systematically and creatively.  ? Our LABS inspire and engage more deeply by providing more detailed analysis of a single issue in global health. A content expert leads highly interactive small group sessions aimed at translating and transferring the latest academic work into insights that change the way we live and work. We encourage shared peer-to-peer learning through reflection on various aspects of the action agenda including leadership, advocacy, collaboration and ethical deliberation.  ?

By improving access to work experience among disadvantage students, we can improve their educational and career outcomes. Immersion in the workplace helps young people to feel that their aspirations are tangible and achievable. Better access to work experience is also an important part of promoting better social mobility and addressing high youth unemployment. Unfortunately, access to work experience is very inequitable. Finding work experience requires connections and social capital. As such, students from low-SES, regional, migrant or Indigenous backgrounds often miss out, or have a very limited range of placements available to them. Our model is to match students, based on their aspirations, with professional work experience opportunities. We promote work experience to businesses as a simple and rewarding way to meet their objectives in community engagement, workplace inclusion and leadership development. We provide expert training and support, drawing on our experience as classroom teachers to develop student-led, project-based work experience that is engaging for both students and staff.We were founded in 2014 and incorporated as a charity in April 2015. In the period April 2015 to 30 June 2016, we saw some wonderful outcomes for the students and workplaces we partner with.In this period, we connected 96 students with one-week work experience placements. We were uniquely student-led in our approach. Through conversations with students and their teachers, we helped students to unpack their interests and to identify their strengths and growth areas. We saw that work experience had a valuable impact on studentsê knowledge, confidence and agency. After work experience, students indicated that they are more motivated to work hard at school, and better prepared to make informed and confident choices about their post-school pathways.For example, one of our students told us:_I was actually thinking about doing easy classes next semester at school and becoming a tradie, but when I finished work experience I have a completely different thought. I'm now thinking about doing more challenging classes and actually going to uni. Saying that scares me but I am going to try and do my bestî.We partnered with eight public schools in disadvantaged parts of Melbourne and regional Victoria. This included all four Shepparton-region public schools as part of the Better Together Alliance (Wanganui Park Secondary College, Shepparton High School, Mooroopna College and McGuire College); Melbourne schools Mill Park Secondary College and Keysborough College, and Horsham College in north-west Victoria. For students from Shepparton and Horsham, we worked with schools to coordinate a ´work experience campê to Melbourne, where we held workshops with students and helped them to reflect and share experiences throughout their place",N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,Y,N,N,,Y,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,0,0,0,5,0,724,24310,25034,1,25035,0,0,0,9549,9549,15486,16486,0,0,N,www.boundless.org.au

An example for me would be the emergence of our Sunday night team who have crafted a new format for gathering people together on a Sunday evening around the concept of being a Worshipping Community. The diversity of those attending this weekly event gives opportunity for a different style of gathering. This allows for moments of the release of Holy Spirit gifts, to times of reflection and prayer, and often giving a younger Christian the opportunity to lead us around Communion. These services are led and crafted by a committed band of people who want to assist in the strengthening of this church family. Our Coffee Team of expert baristas recently reported that through the support of our church family, this simple ministry has seen a profit of $14,000 since its commencement. I was absolutely amazed. These funds have gone to help finance mission projects locally (generally to support programs through Peninsula Christian Care), to supporting missionaries overseas (Keith & Lolita in India and Pastor Radu in Romania have been direct beneficiaries). Every time you see, or hear, the coffee machine operating please know that it is creating work experience for those using it, in addition to funding a mission project somewhere.  I could spend much more time boasting about the things our Childrenês Ministry is achieving; or the passionate growth of our Youth Ministry; the many people still connecting through The Alpha Course; the expanding role of our Reach In ministry; the level of commitment from our Music Ministry team; our weekly service Hosts who coordinate the First Impressions Team every time we meet; the regular gatherings of our Nexus (over 50ês) family; the Connect Groups that meet all over our region; plus the many stories of people volunteering in a host of ways within our local communities.   The impact that our church community has had internationally is staggering. Tens of thousands of people are being directly impacted whether through our finances, direct contact or support for those that are overseeing vital aide and ministry programs. The world may never know our name but heaven rejoices with the souls that have been transformed because of our willingness.  All of this, and more, creates a community. Thatês what we are - a faith community. On the 4th August 2017 Peninsula City Church will celebrate 70 continuous years of ministry service to the community of Frankston and the region of the Mornington Peninsula. It has been an amazing privilege to be a part of this Peninsula City Church family throughout the journey thus far. Letês not get weary, there is much more to do.
