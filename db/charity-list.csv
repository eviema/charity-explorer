We miss him.  We miss his basic goodness and kindness and talents and warmth.  The family_Ü_s aim in establishing this Scholarship Fund and an associated Trust has been to invest Piers_Ü_ own assets for donating to recognised educational and charitable institutions associated with his life.  Piers was a senior training pilot with Qantas so our first aim has been to donate in the area of aviation education and training.  Piers also had volunteer involvement with the Salvation Army, Arthritis Victoria, and Scienceworks.  He was concerned for disadvantaged children and their education, and for homeless people.  He was an organ donor.  All of the things which represent Piers guide the work of the Scholarship Fund and its associated Trust, the Piers K Fowler Trust.  Details relating to the Fund may be found on the website of the Australian Charities and Not for Profits Commission (ACNC).  The Fund must deal specifically with scholarships.  The Trust may distribute benefits more widely but always to DGR-recognised institutions and always to the benefits which Piers would have sought.  The Fund and Trust together made donations of just over $90,000 in this latest financial year, bringing total donations and grants since inception to almost $200,000.  As in the previous year, our donations and gifts were virtually equal to the income earned during the year.  Reflecting Piers_Ü_ own life, Aviation education, training and development forms a major part of the Fund_Ü_s work.  We have a wide-ranging program of aviation-related Scholarships and awards with Swinburne University of Technology (SUT), including one overseas exchange award, support for an instructor rating course, a research award and a number of development / leadership awards.  We also support the SUT Mentoring Program for aviation students developed by Captain Mark Kreiger of Qantas.  Similarly, with the Aviation School of RMIT University, we provide a number of scholarships plus funds to support a Technical Library for all students.  We express our thanks to SUT and RMIT for their support and guidance in establishing our scholarship programs.  In other activities, the Trust is involved with Museum Victoria in the establishment of an interactive aviation-related display at Scienceworks.  Additionally, The Trust continues to support 15 Smith Family children and has provided funding to Melbourne City Mission, the Salvation Army and the Lighthouse Foundation in support of training and activity programs for homeless or potentially homeless people.  The Trust has made contributions in support of Move Arthritis Victoria, a Monash Medical School Scholarship, Ovarian Cancer Australia, St Yared a school for children in Ethiopia, and the Indigenous Literary Foundation.We are pleased to accept public donations (which have to be directed through the DGR-approved Scholarship Fund) but will not be seeking to develop that avenu",Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,0,0,0,1,0,750,37293,38043,10230,48273,0,0,43025,0,1693,44718,3555,0,0,0,0,652142,0,0,0,0,0,652142,0,0,Y,http://gawadkalinga.org.au/

Community foundations act as a bridge for philanthropic giving between donors and beneficiaries. A great supporter of community foundations globally, the US Mott Foundation has written that there is a _Ü_simplicity and the power that underlies the community foundation concept, which is to create a local vehicle that can empower the residents of a community to support causes close to home and close to the heart._Üù  The RACV Community Foundation is that local vehicle for its supporters; the link between the donor, and the charities as the recipient.With a clear focus of improving quality of life of disadvantaged Victorians through mobility, the RACV Community Foundation provides grants to eligible charitable organisations in Victoria. Since its establishment in 1997, the Foundation has distributed $4 million in grants to eligible organisations.  Around half of the grants have been awarded to groups in rural and regional areas, and the Foundation has a strong focus on small, community-based groups.  The Foundation continues to gain understanding of current and emerging community needs. It undertakes investigation and exploration with policy makers, peak bodies, researchers and charities at the coal face to ensure its direction and focus on addressing important needs in the community.The annual granting program and corresponding review with recipients provides data and insight, enabling the Foundation to evaluate its activities against its mission, vision and aims.Along with mandatory strategies such as an investment strategy, the Foundation develops and implements multi-year strategic plans which provide a framework on which the Foundation can continue to build its impact.The Foundation complies with statutory obligations according to the relevant Tax and the Fundraising Acts, Public Ancillary Fund Guidelines, and the Australian Charities and Not For Profit Commission (ACNC). What are we here for?In challenging economic times, the community services that the Foundation helps to fund are being called upon more than ever. It is important that the RACV Community Foundation makes a significant contribution to the social fabric of Victoria. Through our fundraising, management of funds and distribution of grants, we aspire to the Foundation_Ü_s current vision and mission.Vision: To provide a source of philanthropic funding for Victorian charitable and community organisations in order to enhance quality of life.Mission: To provide funds to grassroots community service organisations that look to increase mobility in Victorian communities, with a view to enhancing social cohesion, safety, and/or environmental sustainability.

We also participated in the SA government's 'Citizens Jury' process as an invited witness.We researched the likely social and environmental implications of synthetic biology and new genetic modification (GM) techniques, to identify potential risks.We worked to ensure that ingredients derived from new technologies such as nanotechnology, synthetic biology and new genetic engineering techniques undergo adequate safety testing.We completed a major research project into pesticide contamination in waterways across Australia. The impacts of many chemicals on freshwater ecosystems (for instance on amphibians) is widely documented.We researched many commonly used chemicals (for instance Simazine) and produced education materials on the impacts on natural ecosystems and ways to reduce harm and/or minimise the use of these chemicals in land management practises.We provided major research support for the Australian Pesticide Map, which highlights which pesticides have been detected across the Australian landscape.We worked to ensure the Regional Planning Scheme for the Atherton Tablelands in far north QLD adequately protected World Heritage listed landscapes from inappropriate development.We helped establish a new initiative called Cassowary Keystone Conservation, which aims to reduce predation on cassowaries and other native wildlife by wild dogs.We helped support the work of Frog Safe, which is a group that researches the cause of the decline in frog numbers, which is mainly attributed to a new class of pesticides.We have been supporting the campaign to eradicate yellow crazy ants which is an invasive foreign pest in the Kuranda and Cairns areas which spreads quickly and eradicates virtually all native species. We worked with plantation owners and managers in a number of states to improve land management and remnant indigenous species within their plantations (through actions like wider buffer zones and wildlife corridors).We engaged with Australian, US and European banks, calling on them to avoid investment in new fossil fuel projects on environmental and human rights grounds.We hold concerns about the possibility some trade agreements to undermine the ability of the government to adequately protect the natural environment.

This gives everyone the opportunity to chat about the important transitional phases they may be facing and relate to others whilst picking up skills on how to handle these life changing circumstances in a healthy way. Anyone is welcome to join us in conversation and morning tea. Additional groups for parents, partners and family days are organised throughout the year and an annual camp. Housing ProgramWe offer shared living facilities in two locations in Croydon for easy commuting.Elisha Care wear the costs associated with running the houses and take less than 75% of the average cost of a rental from each housemate. This does not cover rental expenses, utilities and upkeep therefore relying heavily on donations to the ongoing success of the program. Some of our applicants come directly from Jail or rehabilitation centres where they do not have the rental history required to get their own accommodation. Each successful applicant that we house (maximum 8 beds) must contribute to daily tasks and adhere to our strict house rules. Each person is assigned a buddy that can be their support day or night.Volunteer ProgramElisha Care started this program 4 years ago and is one of our biggest successes in rehabilitating the men in our network. We have two established teams working a 4 day week on garden and building maintenance jobs booked in the local area. The team has been generously supported by donated vehicles, trailers and tools to carry out requests by residential and commercial clientele. The efforts to rehabilitate our members with daily purpose and support has been a huge success in their recovery. Uniforms, Insurance, equipment and training are a few of the many ongoing expenses that can be managed through ongoing bookings and donations from the public. The financial expenses outweigh any profit made by the business. Anything that is accrued goes straight back into supporting others.

As the peak body for history in Victoria, the HCV provides a reference point for an understanding of history through its website and public activities. The HCV brings together the major bodies relating to (A) history and heritage in Victoria (Royal Historical Society of Victoria, Museums Australia (Vic), Professional Historians Association (Vic), Heritage Council of Victoria, Museum Victoria, National Trust of Australia Victoria, State Library Victoria, Public Record Office Victoria and Women_Ü_s HERitage Centre Victoria), (B) the history teaching profession (via the History Teachers_Ü_ Association of Victoria, the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority and the state government_Ü_s Department of Education and Training), (C) the media (Australian Broadcasting Corporation), and (D) the universities which teach history (currently, Deakin University, La Trobe University and Monash University).For general audiences, the HCV organised its Annual Lecture (22 Oct 2015) with support from Old Treasury Building and as part of the annual History Week. Professor Lynette Russell (Monash University) lectured on _ÜÛAustralia_Ü_s Big Science Picnic 1914: Some New Evidence_Ü_.For higher education and general audiences, the HCV collaborated with Monash University and State Library Victoria on _ÜÛMaking Public Histories_Ü_, a seminar series led by academic and professional historians. The seminars were: _ÜÛS. T. Gill as eyewitness: art as historical evidence_Ü_ (29 Sep 2015); _ÜÛMelbourne's Alice: Lewis Carroll_Ü_s Alice in Wonderland as source, artefact and inspiration in art, science and history_Ü_ (26 Nov 2015); _ÜÛThe Day that Shook Russell Street_Ü_ (24 Mar 2016); and _ÜÛFirst drafts of History: Rediscovering Victoria_Ü_s war correspondents_Ü_ (21 Apr 2016).For schools, the HCV delivered the History Roadshow to Year 11 and 12 VCE students and their teachers in regional Victoria. A grant from the state Department of Education and Training through its Strategic Partnerships Program supported the program. With the involvement of leading historians in fields related to the students_Ü_ curriculum, the Roadshow visited Rosebud, Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo and Shepparton _Ü_ regional cities that serve as hubs for large numbers of schools.For students in Years 9 and 10, the HCV sponsored the Historical Fiction Competition organised by the History Teachers_Ü_ Association of Victoria.For general and academic audiences, the HCV reached an agreement with Australian Scholarly Publishing to subsidise publication of _ÜÛA History of Victoria's State Secondary Education_Ü_ (the working title for a manuscript commissioned by the HCV).The Board prepared a Strategic Plan for 2016-2019.

Over the course of the year, VWL has been committed to reaching out to members and potential members with a diverse range of events and initiatives. We have focused on ensuring that our association is welcoming and inclusive to women lawyers and law students from a diverse range of backgrounds and perspectives, whether that be cultural, socioeconomic, LGBTIQ, regional and suburban.  VWL delivered almost 40 events and projects that were aimed at examining topics that are important to our members. These included: pay transparency, family violence, revenge porn, addressing unconscious bias, closing the gender pay gap, incarceration of indigenous women, career progression, culturally sensitive legal advice, flexibility and tackling sexism, harassment and gender discrimination. A series of regional events in Geelong, Bendigo and Shepparton, as well as recording and posting videos of our events on our website, represented our efforts to reach out to regional women lawyers.  We continue to contribute to public discourse on law reform and policy. This year our Law Reform and Justice Committees made submissions to the Senate inquiries on the phenomenon colloquially known as _ÜÛrevenge porn_Ü_ and the Fair Work Amendment (Gender Pay Gap) Bill, as well as the Victorian Gender Equality Strategy.   In 2016, VWL matched a record number of 187 pairs of mentors and mentees in our Law Student Mentoring Program. The Program continues to be highly valuable to women who are preparing to enter the legal profession. The second annual Warren Moot saw over 30 VWL members participate in the competition with many adjudicators from the judiciary and the Bar generously donating their time to adjudicate the moot rounds.

This campaign focussed on bringing about positive environmental change through the food we eat. The campaign gets people thinking about the environmental and ethical impact of the food we buy, whilst bringing the sexy back into caring. As part of the campaign we coined the term grexy (green + sexy = sexy greenie), as a way to draw attention to the fact that taking care of the planet is way sexier than trashing it.The four pillars of the campaign were to promote a food system that_Ü_s fair, humane, healthy and good for the environment.298 people signed up to a 30 days to _ÜÛ#grexy_Ü_ challenge which encouraged participants to change their everyday eating habits and reduce landfill waste to reduce their impact on the planet. 91% of respondents said they would sign up again next year. Survey feedback concluded that 83% reduced meat intake, 80% of people no longer order coffee in a disposable cup, 77% reduced plastic packaging, 60% now ask for their drink without a straw or carry their own and 41% of participants now take their own containers to the shops, which further reduces landfill waste.As part of Give a Fork! we also recruited 101 restaurants to participate in the campaign by developing and promoting an environmentally conscious specials dish(es) based on our _ÜÛ4 Food Rules_Ü_ for sustainability. Almost 10,000 specials were sold!Encouraging restaurant participation had multiple benefits. First and foremost, hospitality venues are huge buyers of food and thus can influence the sustainability of supply chains as well as influence how people choose to eat not just out, but also at home.The campaign reached 4.7 million people through PR activities with editorial articles and blogs highlighting the importance of being environmentally conscious through food, reducing plastic packaging and food waste and supporting farmers by purchasing seasonal produce from farmers_Ü_ markets.PUBLISHED WRITING - Sustainable Table developed content for reputable blogs and magazines that promoted reducing waste and reducing our eco-footprint through ethical eating. Publications and blogs included Dumbo Feather, Real Estate.com.au and Nourish Magazine (see Annual Report for more info).EVENTS AND WORKSHOPS - Sustainable Table ran a number of events, workshops and participated in guest speaking engagements to educate people on food sustainability, which included topics such as; Reducing landfill waste and plastic pollution through our food choices, what is sustainable and ethical eating?, reducing food waste at home, supporting ecological farmers and screenings of Plastic Paradise and our own documentary Waste Deep. Through these events we reached and educated an audience of over 2,000 people. http://sustainabletable.org.au/Portals/0/Sustainable%20Tab",Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,0,2,4,4,0,144104,64751,208855,2454,211309,121492,0,27524,0,54239,203255,8054,0,0,0,0,107585,0,0,0,0,24480,83105,0,0,N,http://www.sustainabletable.org.au

We do this by creating resources that underpin skill development, focussing on supporting high risk, under resourced and fast growing areas where there are skill gaps in the workforce, particularly in transport & logistics, construction and children services as well as foundation skills that underpin development of any skills. Aspire focuses on a wide range of learner groups including; those with insufficient language and literacy skills, early school leavers, disaffected youth with learning and social issues, those at risk of facing long-term unemployment, those returning to the workforce, those in rural/remote areas, those wanting recognition of existing skills, and those who are already employed but want to advance their careers and build new skills.Development and provision of learning and support resources to develop new skills and or build on existing skills to support a skilled workforce is a priority of Aspire. We work with Service Skills Organisations as a source of information and services to support their successful transition into the vocational education market. Our foundation will continue to provide opportunities for disadvantaged learners/groups to develop vocational skills leading to further training or employment; we will continue to develop vocational education resources to support the acquisition of foundation and vocational skills and will act as a source of valuable information to government bodies, educators and industry on VET issues.Aspire continued supporting the work experience program for refugees run by the Migrant Resource Centre. This program has been very successful since Aspire started supporting it in 2012, with a number of participants transitioning from their placements to employment. Aspire also provided funding for a new program run by the disability support service Onemda, called Cafê© Ability offering hospitality training opportunities for young people with an intellectual disability. This program has been well run and successful, with great outcomes for the participants, particularly two who have entered employment.  Soon we will work with the Sir David Martin Foundation to support their Accredited Vocational and Educational Training program, run for disadvantaged youth attending the rehabilitation facility Triple Care Farm as well as supporting the Onemda Mobile Training Cafê©: Training Program. This is an extension of their prior programs, which provides training for young disabled learners to work in a mobile cafê© operating in the local community. This program gives participants an opportunity to develop skills in food preparation, customer service and in running a business in a real life environment. *Due to ACNC system limitation we could not report a loss of ($68,999) in 'Other comprehensive income'",N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,Y,N,N,N,N,D,D,18,7,0,0,0,0,4222986,4222986,103232,4326218,2384114,0,25964,0,1875857,4285935,40283,1884583,0,1668458,1668458,3553041,485715,0,86073,86073,571788,2981253,0,40283,N,

Through these activities the Association aims to be instrumental in optimizing the educational opportunities and outcomes for students in all government primary schools in Victoria.  To build leadership capacity in the sector, the VPA offered a high quality Professional Learning program to both members and non-members.  In 2015 - 2016 this included:  -  running and subsidizing over 35 full day workshops that encompassed the many aspects of school leadership. -  an Annual Conference with a two day program of renowned presenters and opportunities for collegiate discussions and networking.  -  the Principals as Literacy Leaders program involving five modules and ten hours follow up coaching for each participant.   This year 85 school leaders were involved in this program.  - a 16 day student study tour to China for 50 students and their teachers which provided outstanding opportunities for cultural exchange and understanding, language acquisition and personal development.   - a highly successful program for aspiring leaders.  - a Statewide Forum which included speakers who presented on a range of key areas in education and was attended by 160 schools leaders from across the state.   Another important aspect of the VPA's work is its advocacy role of advancing public debate in the education field.  This has involved the VPA representing the views and concerns of Victorian government primary school leaders and providing expert advice to government.  To this effect, the VPA was involved on an ongoing basis in government consultations, stakeholder groups and meetings with the various sections of the education department and associated government departments, with Ministers of Educations and other political leaders and with other professional groups and stakeholders.  The VPA has provided information and advice to school leaders through its Member Advisor service, a weekly VPA Newsletter and its website.   Collegiate networking has been facilitated by regular regional meetings where information about government initiatives and effective approaches to teaching and learning, student and staff welfare and school leadership are discussed and shared.   This year 37 such meetings were organised.  A particular focus for the VPA has been supporting smaller rural and remote schools to participate in professional learning.  Twenty scholarships were offered for leaders of these schools to attend the Annual Conference and casual relief teachers were funded to release teaching principals from their classes, enabling them to attend professional learning programs.  The VPA also facilitated four study awards for school leaders to explore initiatives in other states or countries that have direct relevance to students at their own schools.",N,N,N,Y,Y,N,Y,Y,N,N,N,N,N,,N,Y,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,1,11,3,0,249554,0,1369258,1618812,0,1618812,445851,9638,34864,0,899908,1390261,228551,1295960,0,2008160,2008160,3304120,561272,175107,17934,193041,754313,2549807,116884,345435,N,http://www.TheAJT.org.au

To be sustainable in this new era organisations need to focus on growth, with larger organisations having greater resources and an increased capacity to adapt to changing funding models and government regulatory and reporting requirements. This is especially true for not-for-profit (NFP) organisations such as mecwacare, where the alternative to growth is merger or consolidation of smaller providers. This can in turn result in a reduced _ÜÛlocal community_Ü_ service focus, a traditional strength of NFP providers. With this imperative for service growth in mind, the past year saw a range of growth outcomes achieved, with each of our primary services _Ü_ Home Nursing and Care Services, Home Care Packages, Residential Services, Community Housing Services and Community and Disability Services _Ü_ growing substantially and taking significant steps towards future expansion. We were successful in 11 tenders over the past financial year that related to service provision, growing client choice and geographic coverage across Residential Services, Home Nursing and Care Services and Home Care Packages. We expanded our Residential Services to 11 facilities as we welcomed an additional 312 residents to mecwacare. We now have a residential presence in regional Victoria with facilities in Hamlyn Heights (Geelong), in Traralgon in the Latrobe Valley, and in Terang in Western Victoria, alongside the expanded Home Nursing and Care South West Region Service operating from the Ballarat office. This acquisition boosts mecwacare_Ü_s capacity to over 700 beds in 11 facilities, and advances mecwacare_Ü_s five-year strategic plan for growth and sustainability into a Victoria-wide service provider. In the past year mecwacare completed two new builds totaling 50 new Community Housing units. We now provide 89 high quality, long-term affordable homes for financially or socially disadvantaged older people or people with a disability at three locations.  We continued to expand the program variety of mecwacare_Ü_s Community Services at our day centres, with the growth reflected in increased client attendance at both sites. A specialised dementia-specific program began at our Bowen Street Centre in Malvern East, with staff receiving training suited to the special needs of people living with dementia. A complementary new program at the centre provides a social respite to carers of loved ones with dementia. A clinical focus of the organisation has been on end-of-life advance care planning and palliative care, with mecwacare undertaking a long-term project to increase our staff knowledge, improve our clinical processes and client and family experience, and make a substantial contribution to palliative care best practice across our services and the sector more widely.",N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,Y,Y,Y,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,115,647,792,350,45973837,1019339,27653642,74646818,2544150,77190968,45686480,579107,25000,0,31731001,78021588,-830620,29469080,0,159974364,159974364,189443444,150641875,0,1825264,1825264,152467139,36976305,0,-830620,Y,http://www.mecwacare.org.au

We are also the trial sponsors for the first two Australian-led clinical trials for MND. The Cure for MND Foundation has launched two grant schemes with funds available for 2017. Firstly, our Translational Research Grants are available for Australian MND Researchers and are aimed at funding pre-clinical testing of _Ü_ready-to-go_Üù compounds according to the strict, standardised guidelines of the ALS-Therapy Development Institute (ALS-TDI) or supporting drug development and manufacturing of therapies that have strong efficacy data. Grants are awarded for 3 years up to the value of $1 million. Our second grant scheme is aimed at funding Phase II clinical trials. These grants will fund Australian run clinical trials of therapies that have already been tested in Phase I (safety and tolerability) or Phase II (safety and efficacy) trials in MND patients overseas. These are available internationally and for amounts up to $1.5 million dollars. Furthermore, in 2017, the Cure for MND Foundation will be the largest single funder of new assistive equipment for Australian_Ü_s living with MND.

For illegal drugs it exceeds $8.2 billion.Research shows that creating connected communities is the key to preventing alcohol and drug problems. In these communities people feel valued, supported and purposeful.We design and deliver a range of community programs, services and resources targeted at preventing alcohol and other drug-related harm. We know that healthy and resilient communities are the best way to prevent substance use problems. Our programs work to prevent harm in specific environments, changing practices and attitudes to create safer places for people to live, work and play.Our Good Sports program is the first program of its kind to be proven successful in the world _Ü_ so we know it works. There are currently over 7,000 clubs involved in the Good Sports Program, making it Australia_Ü_s largest sport-based health initiative. Participation in the program has been shown to greatly reduce the odds of risky drinking in clubs. Good Sports clubs are 42% less likely to experience alcohol-related harms in clubs. In NSW, we have a program where the community has a real opportunity to make a difference in their local area through joining a Community Drug Action Team to take action to prevent Alcohol and Drug related harm.

HoMie clothes, trains and employs people who are experiencing homelessness in Melbourne. Clothing is distributed to the homeless community during monthly VIP Shopping Days in HoMie, where people who are homeless are invited to shop for free as _ÜÛVIP Customers_Ü_. On VIP Shopping Days, HoMie VIPs not only receive five complementary items of brand-new clothing and dignified shopping experience, but also receive free nutritious food, coffee and haircuts. VIP Shopping Days aim to increase feelings of social connectedness and bring our clients into contact with the HoMie Support Network. Alongside VIP Shopping Days, HoMie trains and employs young homeless Melbournians as retail workers. Through the training program, HoMie aims to provide a genuine pathway out of homelessness through the provision of confidence, skills and jobs.During the 2015/16 financial year, HoMie hosted eight (8) VIP Shopping Days for the homeless community, brought 217 homeless Melbournians into its support network, and distributed 1,085 items of brand new clothing to the homeless community. The HoMie Retail Training & Employment Program began in November 2015 and, although it is not currently an accredited course, has already assisted three (3) young homeless Melbournians. These young people worked a total of 251 hours with HoMie during the 2015/16 financial year, for which they received $5,975.00 in wages. In partnership with the Ladder Foundation, Knowledge Space, Cotton On and Bendigo Bank, HoMie is in the process of designing an accredited Retail Training & Employment Program, to be piloted throughout 2016-17. The Retail Training & Employment Program will see four (4) homeless Melbournians housed, trained as retail workers, and employed by the Cotton On retail chain upon successful graduation next year.2) Charity Tap: Charity Tap is a fundraising system that enables Australian hospitality businesses to fundraise effortlessly for charity. During the 2015/16 financial year, Charity Tap raised $13,333.10, of which 85% was pledged to Oxfam, the Melbourne Period Project, Kids Under Cover and the Self Help Addiction Resource Centre. 15% of funds raised by Charity Tap were used to cover its running costs. 3) Homelessness in Melbourne advocacy:   _ÜÛHomelessess in Melbourne_Ü_ is a social media advocacy program which shares the stories of people who are currently (or have previously) experienced homelessness, to raise awareness of this global issue.

The sophisticated research program is designed to provide genuine innovation in sleep health and alertness management and is generating a unique combination of data that flows across projects to service multiple research strategies. The four platform projects continue to generate large data collection _ÜÛengines_Ü_ for the consortium in the laboratory; the clinic; and in the field. These data feed a highly developed capability in biomathematical modelling and are managed via a comprehensive, scalable and searchable sleep alertness database allowing advanced data analysis and data mining. With strong engagement from many of the end user and academic participant organisations, the Alertness CRC has developed additional and more targeted project concepts that are taking advantage of the large datasets being generated and focused on key outputs. The overall structure of the Alertness CRC_Ü_s research comprise of three Program Leaders and six Theme Leaders facilitates high quality academic supervision of the research activities and has allowed the CRC to more closely monitor the ability of the project activities to generate high impact outputs in Sleep Health management. The Alertness CRC Education Committee continues to oversee comprehensive and diverse education and training component. With a total of 24 post doctoral fellows active in the research program at of 30 June 2016, these early career researchers have been given prominent roles in project teams with some taking on Project Leader positions. This responsibility and the ability to interact with senior end user representatives is a key factor in building capacity, aligning their skills and expertise to output driven research and exposing them to industry practices and pressures.The PhD program includes 18 students currently enrolled and integrated into the platform projects and core activities of the CRC. The Master program currently includes two students and is particularly vital to the creation of a _ÜÛpipeline_Ü_ of PhD candidates. The CRC has also supported a number of shorter term vacation scholarships.The CRC has worked closely with the Sleep Health Foundation (SHF) and through the SHF, the Alertness CRC has access to an expanded network of industry stakeholders and consumer groups particularly in the area of sleep health service delivery. Working with the SHF, the CRC is seeking to further influence the national health agenda in recognition of the importance of sleep health by reporting data on economic impact of sleep disruption and sleep disorders.",Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,4,3,1,0,2232000,0,1687227,3919227,46812,3966039,943659,0,597423,0,3212661,4753743,-787704,3905225,0,8281,8281,3913506,1166752,0,0,0,1166752,2746754,0,-787704,Y,http://www.alertnesscrc.com/

We are a registered, tax deductible, GST exempt, not for profit charity and relies on public donations and unpaid volunteers to operate a charitable service available to all veterinary clinic clients in Victoria.    The PMCF relies on unpaid volunteers and is run by the founder, Jennifer Hunt, who aims to get 100% of donations to assist pensioners and disadvantaged pet owners to save their pet's lives.  The charity relies on public donations, is run by unpaid volunteers and expects veterinary care to be not for profit in keeping with our charitable status so as to optimise effectiveness of donations.    When a pet becomes unwell and is in danger of being unnecessarily euthanized the PMCF uses a case-by-case process to determine suitability for assistance:    PMCF asks the vet to explain the pet and owner's circumstances and to outline the plan of care.  We ask vets to discount their costs to being not for profit.  We then talk with the owner to determine their circumstances and whether they have exhausted all avenues of finding funds.  Once established as being in necessitous circumstances, we ask the owner how much they can put towards the cost of veterinary care and aim to bridge the gap up to a maximum of $1,000.  If meeting our criteria (ie. the owner has explained their circumstances that leave them in necessitous circumstances, they have exhausted all sources of finding funds to provide veterinary care and the pet is in danger of being unnecessarily euthanized as explained by a registered veterinarian) the charity determines eligibility and amount to be donated to save the pet's life.  We ask for a social story - where the pet came from, why they are important to their owner, social / financial circumstances, what illness / injury the pet has sustained and what is needed to be done to save their lives.    We ask for clear photos to be sent electronically and to be used on our Facebook page to show the charity's activities and create transparency.  Owners are asked to participate by allowing the local (or larger) media to run the story, to thank the PMCF and to allow our website to be published for donations to be made to assist the next case.  The charity commenced in 2010 and since 'getting our stride' in 2012 we have assisted over 350 pensioner's to prevent their pets from being unnecessarily euthanized.",Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Pet owners in necessitous circumstances.,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,0,0,0,6,0,72089,0,72089,0,72089,0,0,72626,0,0,72626,-537,0,0,0,0,24612,0,0,0,0,537,24075,0,0,Y,

It is with awe and pride that I share with you the 2015/2016 financial year.  Bridging Worx was on the move once again, settling in to our new office in Gladstone Park. We are now settled in and confident that this will be our base for quite some time to come. We also made thedecision to expand to where our services are located, setting up an office in Armstrong Street, Ballarat.This year saw the departure if our General Manager as well as our Financial Controller as we aimed toreduce overheads and streamline processes/services to be able to focus our much needed resources onproviding outcomes for the people we support. We also saw the departure of our Disability ServicesManager, Melissa Pool. This was not a goodbye, with her taking up a position on our Board, enablingher to remain actively involved in the strategic direction and growth of the organisation. This lead to anopportunity for promotion for our Disability Services Co-ordinator Andre Cofre, seeing him take on therole of Disability Services Manager in October of 2016. Andre has proven to be a huge asset to theorganisation and has been instrumental in assisting me with the growth and future direction of BridgingWorx to ensure it becomes a disability service provider of choice. The rollout of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) within the North East MetropolitanArea (NEMA) has seen us working diligently to ensure that we are well prepared and well placed for the roll out for our clients within the Central Highlands region in January 2017. I'm also extremely proud of the funding extension in our Justice Program Genesis working with Pacific & Maori (CALD) background inmates in their pre and post release from Prison.  Our Emerge Program (Youth Diversionary for Pacific & Maori) has grown in strengths with a strategic view to expand the program into mainstream.  This is an ever changing landscape, but we are excited about the benefits the NDIS will provide for people with disability and we are confident that the work we have been doing, and we will continue to do will prove fruitful in the long term not only for the organisation, but for the people we continue to support. I am extremely proud of the team I have both working both for me and with me and I look forward to another year of challenges, growth and positive outcomes ahead for all.",Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,2,3,10,9,256025,16328,50717,323070,7293,330363,108959,0,28000,0,94503,231462,98901,283947,0,0,22610,306557,300704,0,0,0,300704,5853,0,98901,Y,http://www.bridgingworx.org.au

Through an extensive grant making program, the Foundation supports families undergoing treatment, partners with hospitals to deliver clinical excellence and funds clinical research and clinical trials with the aim to develop new and kinder treatments for children with cancer. In 2015/16 the Foundation supported families through the stress of cancer treatment by funding the salaries of Family Resource Coordinators, and by providing therapeutic storybooks and Music and Art Therapy to assist children with adapting to treatment. The Foundation also funded The Beaded Journey, a therapeutic program which helps each patient mark every treatment milestone with a special bead; this program assists children and their families to cope with their cancer experience and relate their experience visually. In 2017 the Foundation will announce major new grants for projects that span the cancer treatment journey, from family support and clinical care to ground breaking clinical research and clinical trials, including one national project.At all times, the Foundation endeavours to raise funds in a way which is both efficient and ethical. The Foundation does not conduct public raffles or telemarketing. Nor do we receive government funding. Funds are raised through The Million Dollar Lunch, community fundraising, corporate sponsorship and donations. A volunteer board of directors and a large team of dedicated volunteers help us maximise our fundraising income, while the generosity of many pro bono supporters _Ü_ office space, marketing, design, legal and insurance _Ü_ ensure that our administration overheads over the past 5 years have averaged just 9%.

To undertake such a task in a small way requires funds. ECHO has assisted other charities in intersection tin shake collections building up expertise and knowledge in the field. The outcome of this program is that scarce funds are collected and distributed to much needed causes; the collectors themselves feel a net worth and self esteem in not only raising funds but also earning income rather than being on welfare.During the past year the money raised by ECHO which was not forwarded to partner charity organisations was used to purchase or trade in medical aids such as electric wheelchairs, walkers and shower aids. These are products for which there are extended waiting lists from different levels of Government. We were able to source and place two electric wheel chairs which were provided to housebound clients.Another activity we have has been the receipt of donated goods for distribution to those less fortunate. We have an active blanket program in the Winter and we provide some food relief to those in need who are drawn to our attention.
